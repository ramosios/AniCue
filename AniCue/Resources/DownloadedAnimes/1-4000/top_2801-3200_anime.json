The character typically manifested as a young and impoverished female adolescent who sold camellia flowers on the streets. One incarnation of the character features in a short story, also titled \"Shouji Tsubaki,\" within an anthology\u2014eventually repurposed as a full-length graphic novel by Suehiro Maruo, known as Mr. Arashi\u2019s Amazing Freak Show in English. This, in turn, was adapted into the animated film Chika Gentou Gekiga: Shoujo Tsubaki, which roughly translates to \"Underground Projected Dramatic Pictures: The Camellia Girl.\" The film is known simply as Midori in releases outside of Japan. Aside from the music, sound effects, and an uncredited voice cast, the entirety of the film was created almost exclusively by Hiroshi Harada under the pseudonym \"Hisaaki Etsu,\" who handled directing, scripting, drawing, and animating. Composer J. A. Seazer assisted with the soundtrack. Production began in 1987, the film took five years to produce, and it consists of over five thousand hand-drawn sheets of animation. Due to the film\u2019s graphic imagery, the production received no sponsors and was instead funded using Harada\u2019s life savings and retirement fund. The early marketing for the film was deliberately cryptic, and Harada intended for it to only be viewed at specially held screenings. The film premiered in May 1992 under a large red tent at the Mitake Jinja Shinto Shrine in Tokyo. It was accompanied by realtime special effects, including confetti and smoke bombs. Underground theater group Aka Neko Za performed stunts from the film and interacted with the audience throughout its duration. These performances would complement the film in succeeding years, before its ban. Chika Gentou Gekiga: Shoujo Tsubaki was screened unedited until 1994, when Japanese film censor board Eirin made 26 cuts and alterations. From 1994 to 2006, the film could only be viewed in its heavily censored state at film festival screenings and theaters. During this time, there were no home releases. In 1999, the film was screened at the San Sebasti\u00e1n Horror and Fantasy Film Festival in Spain. When the tapes were returned to Japan, they were seized and destroyed by Japanese Customs at Narita Airport; it was thereafter banned from domestic imports and screenings in Japan. Nonetheless, it was specially screened at the Tokyo International Fantastic Film Festival in 2004, where it won first place in a fan vote. Directly after, a ban was placed on the film at the request of the police, which lasted eight more years in Japan. In 2006, the French company Cin\u00e9 Malta obtained the rights to release the film on DVD in its original form. This was the first time the uncensored version of Midori was accessible since screenings before 1994. The DVD also included English, Spanish, Italian, and German subtitles, as well various features\u2014including a recorded interview with Harada and a 16-page booklet. However, the tapes initially sent to France were confiscated as \"obscene material\" at De Gaulle Airport due to cautionary notices attached to the shipments by Narita Airport. As of the 2010s, the film was screened frequently throughout Asia and Europe\u2014especially the latter\u2014but never in the United States, due to import laws regarding certain types of pornography. In 2013, the original 16 mm negatives of the film were discovered in a warehouse belonging to Japanese post-production company IMAGICA. The film was remastered and screened in digital format, including at the Kanazawa Film Festival that same year. Regardless, Chika Gentou Gekiga: Shoujo Tsubaki will forever be notorious for its taboo content and complex history. It is in some regards considered lost media and is also considered one of the most controversial anime due to being banned almost everywhere, including in Japan.", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 170, "type": "anime", "name": "Imagica", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/170/Imagica"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 1441, "type": "anime", "name": "Mippei Eigeki Kiryuukan", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1441/Mippei_Eigeki_Kiryuukan"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 14, "type": "anime", "name": "Horror", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/14/Horror"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 58, "type": "anime", "name": "Gore", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/58/Gore"}, {"mal_id": 13, "type": "anime", "name": "Historical", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 50204, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/50204/Tokyo_24-ku", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1442/120112.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1442/120112t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1442/120112l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1442/120112.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1442/120112t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1442/120112l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "lUfoZt0FHMc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUfoZt0FHMc", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/lUfoZt0FHMc?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/lUfoZt0FHMc/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/lUfoZt0FHMc/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/lUfoZt0FHMc/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/lUfoZt0FHMc/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/lUfoZt0FHMc/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Tokyo 24-ku"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Tokyo Twenty Fourth Ward"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u6771\u4eac24\u533a"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Tokyo 24th Ward"}], "title": "Tokyo 24-ku", "title_english": "Tokyo 24th Ward", "title_japanese": "\u6771\u4eac24\u533a", "title_synonyms": ["Tokyo Twenty Fourth Ward"], "type": "TV", "source": "Original", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2022-01-06T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2022-04-07T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 6, "month": 1, "year": 2022}, "to": {"day": 7, "month": 4, "year": 2022}}, "string": "Jan 6, 2022 to Apr 7, 2022"}, "duration": "24 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 6.34, "scored_by": 22377, "rank": 8231, "popularity": 2803, "members": 72416, "favorites": 208, "synopsis": "In a special jurisdiction area built in Tokyo Bay commonly known as the 24th Ward, the population enjoys a very safe life thanks to the Hazard Cast\u2014a surveillance system that predicts accidents and assists victims immediately.

The union of the two blood lines is supposed to bring forth Earth's strongest martial arts clan. \n\nSkip forward: Koushi is in high school, oblivious to the marriage arranged for him at his birth. Enter Momoko Kuzuryuu: sugar bomb, airhead, loli martial arts artist and Koushi's self-proclaimed bride (the strongest on Earth, no less). Her wish for sexual intercourse meets with Koushi's square refusal as he has absolutely no desire to get it on with someone who looks like she could be his little sister, not to mention that he doesn't have the foggiest idea who she actually is. \n\nMeanwhile, a war has broken out between the martial arts families. For Koushi, this means that numerous fighters are out to challenge/assassinate him. As if that weren't bad enough, our protagonist also has a fight phobia due to a traumatic incident that took place in his childhood. Now it's up to Momoko and her superhuman fighting skills to protect her \"husband.\" Will the two sweethearts survive the trials and tribulations ahead of them?

Two sisters form the newest generation of holy women who protect the lands from monsters and calamities. The eldest, Philia, is considered a prodigy in the field, capable of solving any problem in no time. Meanwhile, the youngest, Mia, is not as extraordinary as her older sister but has charmed the entire country with her lovely personality. Despite their striking differences, Philia and Mia share an unbreakable bond.\n\nSadly, Mia is the only person who truly cares for Philia. Because of Philia's expressionless face and aloof demeanor, their parents always scold her, and the citizens complain about her. Moreover, Julius Girtonia, the second prince and Philia's fianc\u00e9, would rather have a more amicable girl as his wife-to-be. For that reason, he cancels the engagement and sells Philia off to the neighboring kingdom, Parnacorta, which has recently lost its own saint.\n\nHaving no say on the matter, Philia immediately goes to serve Parnacorta. As a foreigner, she presumes that she will not be treated much better than in Girtonia.

They make many friends along the way, be they sentient woodland creatures like Iwashi the Weasel or fellow miniature people such as the songstress Konju and the inventor Sen.\n\nHakumei to Mikochi is a relaxing look into the day-to-day lives of its titular characters as they explore and interact with their tiny world which seems to be straight out of a fairy tale.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "winter", "year": 2018, "broadcast": {"day": "Fridays", "time": "21:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Fridays at 21:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 104, "type": "anime", "name": "Lantis", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/104/Lantis"}, {"mal_id": 238, "type": "anime", "name": "AT-X", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"}, {"mal_id": 737, "type": "anime", "name": "Sony Music Communications", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/737/Sony_Music_Communications"}, {"mal_id": 1551, "type": "anime", "name": "Kadokawa Media House", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1551/Kadokawa_Media_House"}, {"mal_id": 1696, "type": "anime", "name": "Kadokawa", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 376, "type": "anime", "name": "Sentai Filmworks", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 456, "type": "anime", "name": "Lerche", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/456/Lerche"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 36, "type": "anime", "name": "Slice of Life", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 51, "type": "anime", "name": "Anthropomorphic", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/51/Anthropomorphic"}, {"mal_id": 63, "type": "anime", "name": "Iyashikei", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/63/Iyashikei"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 42, "type": "anime", "name": "Seinen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]}, {"mal_id": 39819, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/39819/Bokutachi_wa_Benkyou_ga_Dekinai__Nagisa_ni_Usemono_Arite_Senjin_wa_Enzen_to_X_Suru", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1530/102782.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1530/102782t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1530/102782l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1530/102782.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1530/102782t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1530/102782l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai: Nagisa ni Usemono Arite Senjin wa Enzen to [X] Suru"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai OVA"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u307c\u304f\u305f\u3061\u306f\u52c9\u5f37\u304c\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u300c\u6e1a\u306b\u5931\u305b\u3082\u306e\u3042\u308a\u3066\u5148\u4eba\u306f\u8276\u7136\u3068[X]\u3059\u308b\u300d"}, {"type": "English", "title": "We Never Learn: BOKUBEN -

This all changes, however, when a blue robotic cat appears from his desk drawer. Calling himself Doraemon, this robot tells Nobita that his future descendants from the 22nd century live in poverty because of all the mistakes he made. Therefore, they have sent Doraemon to serve as a guide and mentor to Nobita, so that their future may change for the better. What Doraemon comes to learn, though, is that Nobita is the weakest and laziest student in the whole school.\n\nTo assist in his quest, Doraemon has a four-dimensional pocket with him, in which he keeps various machines and gadgets from the future. Unfortunately, these often result in even more trouble for Nobita. Will Doraemon really be able to achieve his mission of changing Nobita, or will he remain as he is?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 1979, "broadcast": {"day": "Fridays", "time": "19:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Fridays at 19:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 55, "type": "anime", "name": "TV Asahi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/55/TV_Asahi"}, {"mal_id": 142, "type": "anime", "name": "Asatsu DK", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/142/Asatsu_DK"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 247, "type": "anime", "name": "Shin-Ei Animation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/247/Shin-Ei_Animation"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 51, "type": "anime", "name": "Anthropomorphic", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/51/Anthropomorphic"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 15, "type": "anime", "name": "Kids", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/15/Kids"}, {"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]}, {"mal_id": 55318, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/55318/Medalist", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1029/146850.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1029/146850t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1029/146850l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1029/146850.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1029/146850t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1029/146850l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "sCOZVBN0vC0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCOZVBN0vC0", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/sCOZVBN0vC0?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/sCOZVBN0vC0/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/sCOZVBN0vC0/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/sCOZVBN0vC0/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/sCOZVBN0vC0/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/sCOZVBN0vC0/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Medalist"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30e1\u30c0\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8"}], "title": "Medalist", "title_english": null, "title_japanese": "\u30e1\u30c0\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "TV", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 13, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2025-01-05T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2025-03-30T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 5, "month": 1, "year": 2025}, "to": {"day": 30, "month": 3, "year": 2025}}, "string": "Jan 5, 2025 to Mar 30, 2025"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 8.37, "scored_by": 28345, "rank": 238, "popularity": 2868, "members": 69652, "favorites": 451, "synopsis": "Tsukasa Akeuraji always dreamed of becoming a competitive solo figure skater, but starting too late in life meant his ambitions never got off the ground.

For Yajirou, it is restoring his former shapeshifting abilities, whilst little Yashirou is content with continuing his work at the family\u2019s factory. But for the third son, Yasaburou, it simply means embracing the \"fool's blood\" he inherited from his father and living a carefree but interesting life. This, of course, includes hunting for the mysterious and elusive snake-like creature known as a tsuchinoko, and causing ripples of trouble at every turn.\n\nHowever, these ripples threaten to turn into waves with the return of Nidaime, the estranged son of the brothers' tengu teacher, Professor Akadama. Nidaime bears a grudge against not only his father, but his father's apprentice Benten as well. His loyalties suddenly brought into question, Yasaburou must use his tanuki wit to appease all sides without getting caught in the crossfire, before the delicate balance between human, tengu, and tanuki is overthrown and all hell breaks loose.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 2017, "broadcast": {"day": "Sundays", "time": "22:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Sundays at 22:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 104, "type": "anime", "name": "Lantis", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/104/Lantis"}, {"mal_id": 1261, "type": "anime", "name": "Good Smile Company", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1261/Good_Smile_Company"}, {"mal_id": 1334, "type": "anime", "name": "Docomo Anime Store", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1334/Docomo_Anime_Store"}, {"mal_id": 1492, "type": "anime", "name": "Yomiuri TV Enterprise", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1492/Yomiuri_TV_Enterprise"}, {"mal_id": 1542, "type": "anime", "name": "DMM.com", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1542/DMMcom"}, {"mal_id": 1587, "type": "anime", "name": "Cygames", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1587/Cygames"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 132, "type": "anime", "name": "P.A.

Following the conclusion of the third Grail War, a US-based organization with magi distinct from the London-based Mage Association, used data from Fuyuki's Grail War to plan their own ritual. Seventy years later, they used the city of Snowfield as the Sacred Land for their own Grail War. However, they were unable to successfully replicate every aspect of the ritual, resulting in it acting only as an imitation that has lost the Saber class and allowed for the summoning of strange Servants due to the blurring of the definition of a \"hero.\"\n\nRohngall and his pupil, Faldeus, have been dispatched by the Mage's Association to investigate the city and the state of the war. Faldeus, a US organization spy, has Rohngall sniped upon his arrival, despite knowing that Rohngall is a puppet. He declares that their Holy Grail War has been in development and is real, causing a commotion at the Clock Tower, and that he wishes to \"advertise\" the project to the Association.\n\n(Source: MAL News)", "background": "Episode 1 received an advance release on Crunchyroll's YouTube channel on November 23, 2024, and on the Fate Project New Year's Eve TV Special on December 31, 2024.", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": "Unknown"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 17, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 56, "type": "anime", "name": "A-1 Pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/56/A-1_Pictures"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 82, "type": "anime", "name": "Urban Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/82/Urban_Fantasy"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 55877, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/55877/Henjin_no_Salad_Bowl", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1861/141482.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1861/141482t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1861/141482l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1861/141482.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1861/141482t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1861/141482l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "NWcAykaLqsc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWcAykaLqsc", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/NWcAykaLqsc?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/NWcAykaLqsc/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/NWcAykaLqsc/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/NWcAykaLqsc/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/NWcAykaLqsc/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/NWcAykaLqsc/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Henjin no Salad Bowl"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Salad Bowl of Eccentrics"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Hensara"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u5909\u4eba\u306e\u30b5\u30e9\u30c0\u30dc\u30a6\u30eb"}, {"type": "English", "title": "A Salad Bowl of Eccentrics"}], "title": "Henjin no Salad Bowl", "title_english": "A Salad Bowl of Eccentrics", "title_japanese": "\u5909\u4eba\u306e\u30b5\u30e9\u30c0\u30dc\u30a6\u30eb", "title_synonyms": ["Salad Bowl of Eccentrics", "Hensara"], "type": "TV", "source": "Light novel", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2024-04-05T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2024-06-21T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 5, "month": 4, "year": 2024}, "to": {"day": 21, "month": 6, "year": 2024}}, "string": "Apr 5, 2024 to Jun 21, 2024"}, "duration": "24 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.27, "scored_by": 28964, "rank": 3067, "popularity": 2908, "members": 68001, "favorites": 167, "synopsis": "Private detective Sousuke Kaburaya is simply trying to make ends meet when Sara da Odin, an imperial princess from another world, falls through a portal right on top of him.

The high schoolers are not pleased that these middle schoolers are allowed into the camp, but the middle schoolers easily overwhelm them before they are halted by the coaches.\n\nThe rules of the camp are soon explained: the players are split into one of 16 courts based on skill, with the best players occupying Court 1. Players move up and down courts based on \"shuffle matches\" that occur before practice begins each day. In anticipation of a game, the middle schoolers are asked to pair up with one another, only to find out that they would not be playing doubles with their partners. Instead, they are pitted against each other in a tiebreaker-style game. The winner of the match would be allowed to stay to further develop their skills whereas the loser would be sent home.\n\nFor the sake of tennis, friendships and camaraderie are all put on the line. As the fierce competition between the middle and high schoolers persists, the situations they find themselves in goes deeper than just playing to remain in the camp.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "winter", "year": 2012, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": "Unknown"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 16, "type": "anime", "name": "TV Tokyo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"}, {"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai Visual", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/23/Bandai_Visual"}, {"mal_id": 139, "type": "anime", "name": "Nihon Ad Systems", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/139/Nihon_Ad_Systems"}, {"mal_id": 717, "type": "anime", "name": "TV Tokyo Music", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/717/TV_Tokyo_Music"}, {"mal_id": 751, "type": "anime", "name": "Marvelous AQL", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/751/Marvelous_AQL"}, {"mal_id": 1365, "type": "anime", "name": "Shueisha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1365/Shueisha"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Production I.G", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"}, {"mal_id": 463, "type": "anime", "name": "M.S.C", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/463/MSC"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 30, "type": "anime", "name": "Sports", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/30/Sports"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]}, {"mal_id": 59265, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/59265/Magic_Maker__Isekai_Mahou_no_Tsukurikata", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1802/146725.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1802/146725t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1802/146725l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1802/146725.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1802/146725t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1802/146725l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "i_p5slC_n54", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_p5slC_n54", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/i_p5slC_n54?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/i_p5slC_n54/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/i_p5slC_n54/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/i_p5slC_n54/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/i_p5slC_n54/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/i_p5slC_n54/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Magic Maker: Isekai Mahou no Tsukurikata"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Magic Maker: How to Create Magic in Another World"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30de\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30e1\u30a4\u30ab\u30fc \uff0d\u7570\u4e16\u754c\u9b54\u6cd5\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9\uff0d"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Magic Maker: How to Make Magic in Another World"}], "title": "Magic Maker: Isekai Mahou no Tsukurikata", "title_english": "Magic Maker: How to Make Magic in Another World", "title_japanese": "\u30de\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30e1\u30a4\u30ab\u30fc \uff0d\u7570\u4e16\u754c\u9b54\u6cd5\u306e\u4f5c\u308a\u65b9\uff0d", "title_synonyms": ["Magic Maker: How to Create Magic in Another World"], "type": "TV", "source": "Light novel", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2025-01-09T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2025-03-27T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 9, "month": 1, "year": 2025}, "to": {"day": 27, "month": 3, "year": 2025}}, "string": "Jan 9, 2025 to Mar 27, 2025"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 6.82, "scored_by": 31697, "rank": 5347, "popularity": 2929, "members": 67226, "favorites": 132, "synopsis": "A 30-year-old man who dreams of becoming a wizard suddenly loses his life.

When Yamato arrives, it is revealed that the rundown park was where the two of them first talked and bonded for the first time. After bantering a bit, Kai asks Yamato why he, who had always seemed to be having fun with a large crowd around him, was always the first one at the park after school. Yamato admits that he used to feel like he was a chameleon; someone who didn't have his own personality and just changed himself to please others. Kai tells Yamato that he used to hate the town, but thanks to Yamato, he now finds it to be beautiful. Kai reassures him that he is his own person, and Yamato confesses that after he met Mei, he realized just how lonely he was. Kai later runs into Megumi at the bus stop. They start talking, and Kai tells her that he thinks she's cool for staying true to herself while modelling. Megumi snaps back at him, and Kai, offended, leaves.

What is her part to play in its plan, and how are the men around her connected to it all?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "summer", "year": 2020, "broadcast": {"day": "Thursdays", "time": "00:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Thursdays at 00:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 3051, "type": "anime", "name": "Anime Limited", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/3051/Anime_Limited"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 569, "type": "anime", "name": "MAPPA", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/569/MAPPA"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 7, "type": "anime", "name": "Mystery", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 73, "type": "anime", "name": "Reverse Harem", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/73/Reverse_Harem"}, {"mal_id": 31, "type": "anime", "name": "Super Power", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/31/Super_Power"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 40165, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/40165/Listeners", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1589/106391.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1589/106391t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1589/106391l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1589/106391.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1589/106391t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1589/106391l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "M9dINy-ZDlQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9dINy-ZDlQ", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/M9dINy-ZDlQ?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/M9dINy-ZDlQ/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/M9dINy-ZDlQ/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/M9dINy-ZDlQ/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/M9dINy-ZDlQ/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/M9dINy-ZDlQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Listeners"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "LISTENERS \u30ea\u30b9\u30ca\u30fc\u30ba"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Listeners"}], "title": "Listeners", "title_english": "Listeners", "title_japanese": "LISTENERS \u30ea\u30b9\u30ca\u30fc\u30ba", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "TV", "source": "Original", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2020-04-04T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2020-06-20T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 4, "month": 4, "year": 2020}, "to": {"day": 20, "month": 6, "year": 2020}}, "string": "Apr 4, 2020 to Jun 20, 2020"}, "duration": "24 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 5.4, "scored_by": 22587, "rank": 12768, "popularity": 2942, "members": 66554, "favorites": 56, "synopsis": "Set in a world where the concept of music ceases to exist.

However, humans have come to forget and jest at the existence of demons, and no longer understand the privilege it is to live without fear.

They live in the world of the demons. It is now up to Otoha to prove himself as a Karas, and restore the balance that Eko threatens to upset.\n\nMeanwhile, a superstitious police officer named Sagisaka and his rational new recruit, Kure, follow the trail of the murders dealt by Eko's Mikura, as well as the trail of a rogue Mikura named Nue.

Moreover, an unexpected loved one reappears, strengthening the duke and Alice's hope to break the curse and finally close the distance between them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 2024, "broadcast": {"day": "Sundays", "time": "22:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Sundays at 22:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 62, "type": "anime", "name": "Shogakukan-Shueisha Productions", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/62/Shogakukan-Shueisha_Productions"}, {"mal_id": 474, "type": "anime", "name": "Shogakukan Music & Digital Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/474/Shogakukan_Music___Digital_Entertainment"}, {"mal_id": 1113, "type": "anime", "name": "NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1113/NBCUniversal_Entertainment_Japan"}, {"mal_id": 1416, "type": "anime", "name": "BS11", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1416/BS11"}, {"mal_id": 1430, "type": "anime", "name": "Shogakukan", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1430/Shogakukan"}, {"mal_id": 1492, "type": "anime", "name": "Yomiuri TV Enterprise", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1492/Yomiuri_TV_Enterprise"}, {"mal_id": 1992, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai Spirits", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1992/Bandai_Spirits"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 7, "type": "anime", "name": "J.C.Staff", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/7/JCStaff"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 74, "type": "anime", "name": "Love Status Quo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/74/Love_Status_Quo"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 33075, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/33075/Musaigen_no_Phantom_World__Mizutama_no_Kiseki", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/82387.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/82387t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/82387l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/82387.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/82387t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/82387l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "FAb_Eh4L1Eo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAb_Eh4L1Eo", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/FAb_Eh4L1Eo?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/FAb_Eh4L1Eo/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/FAb_Eh4L1Eo/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/FAb_Eh4L1Eo/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/FAb_Eh4L1Eo/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/FAb_Eh4L1Eo/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Musaigen no Phantom World: Mizutama no Kiseki"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u7121\u5f69\u9650\u306e\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30c8\u30e0\u30fb\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9 \u6c34\u7389\u306e\u5947\u8de1"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Myriad Colors Phantom World Special"}], "title": "Musaigen no Phantom World: Mizutama no Kiseki", "title_english": "Myriad Colors Phantom World Special", "title_japanese": "\u7121\u5f69\u9650\u306e\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30c8\u30e0\u30fb\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9 \u6c34\u7389\u306e\u5947\u8de1", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "Special", "source": "Light novel", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2016-10-05T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 5, "month": 10, "year": 2016}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Oct 5, 2016"}, "duration": "23 min", "rating": "PG-13 -

Nevertheless, Alyssa adores her child despite Viola's possessive streak and tendency to drive away anyone she fears will take away her mother's love. Viola may not be sure where she came from, though she has all she needs in Alyssa and the plethora of Alyssa's friends who have come together to raise her. Under Alyssa's guidance, Viola will learn to master her magic and make her adoptive mother proud.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Dekoboko Majo no Oyako Jijou was released on Blu-ray on March 13, 2024.", "season": "fall", "year": 2023, "broadcast": {"day": "Sundays", "time": "22:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Sundays at 22:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 513, "type": "anime", "name": "Nikkatsu", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/513/Nikkatsu"}, {"mal_id": 874, "type": "anime", "name": "Flex Comix", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/874/Flex_Comix"}, {"mal_id": 1344, "type": "anime", "name": "King Records", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1344/King_Records"}, {"mal_id": 1492, "type": "anime", "name": "Yomiuri TV Enterprise", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1492/Yomiuri_TV_Enterprise"}, {"mal_id": 2431, "type": "anime", "name": "Happinet Phantom Studios", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2431/Happinet_Phantom_Studios"}, {"mal_id": 2671, "type": "anime", "name": "Saber Links", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2671/Saber_Links"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 1257, "type": "anime", "name": "A-Real", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1257/A-Real"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 57, "type": "anime", "name": "Gag Humor", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/57/Gag_Humor"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 38302, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/38302/Boku_no_Tonari_ni_Ankoku_Hakaishin_ga_Imasu", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1848/103547.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1848/103547t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1848/103547l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1848/103547.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1848/103547t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1848/103547l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "7DR1E7E2gc0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DR1E7E2gc0", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/7DR1E7E2gc0?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/7DR1E7E2gc0/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/7DR1E7E2gc0/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/7DR1E7E2gc0/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/7DR1E7E2gc0/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/7DR1E7E2gc0/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Boku no Tonari ni Ankoku Hakaishin ga Imasu."}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Bokuhaka"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u307c\u304f\u306e\u3068\u306a\u308a\u306b\u6697\u9ed2\u7834\u58ca\u795e\u304c\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002"}, {"type": "English", "title": "A Destructive God Sits Next to Me"}, {"type": "German", "title": "A Destructive God Sits Next to Me"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "A Destructive God Sits Next to Me"}, {"type": "French", "title": "A Destructive God Sits Next to Me"}], "title": "Boku no Tonari ni Ankoku Hakaishin ga Imasu.", "title_english": "A Destructive God Sits Next to Me", "title_japanese": "\u307c\u304f\u306e\u3068\u306a\u308a\u306b\u6697\u9ed2\u7834\u58ca\u795e\u304c\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002", "title_synonyms": ["Bokuhaka"], "type": "TV", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2020-01-11T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2020-03-28T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 11, "month": 1, "year": 2020}, "to": {"day": 28, "month": 3, "year": 2020}}, "string": "Jan 11, 2020 to Mar 28, 2020"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 6.62, "scored_by": 22020, "rank": 6502, "popularity": 3003, "members": 63792, "favorites": 267, "synopsis": "In the distant past, Miguel, the God of Destruction, was sealed inside the knight who ruled over light and darkness, Sturmhurt.

When several disappearances occur throughout Paris, the young knight believes that they are somehow connected to his sister's death. Hoping to find her killers, D'Eon joins the secret police to investigate the incidents.\n\nFollowing the clues, they piece together that a conspiracy between members of the French and Russian nobility, spurred on by a cult, may be behind the disappearances. D'Eon concludes that Lia may have uncovered the truth while on a mission and was killed as a result.\n\nThat night, the secret police are to arrest the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans on suspicion of being the mastermind. One of their own transforms into a demon called a Gargoyle and massacres the group. D'Eon attempts to rescue the sole survivor, only to find that he too has been transformed. During the ensuing battle, D'Eon is possessed by Lia's vengeful soul, who takes command of his body and slays the Gargoyle herself. In the aftermath, D'Eon must gather allies to discover the depth of this supernatural conspiracy.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "summer", "year": 2006, "broadcast": {"day": "Saturdays", "time": "19:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Saturdays at 19:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 33, "type": "anime", "name": "WOWOW", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/33/WOWOW"}, {"mal_id": 109, "type": "anime", "name": "Shochiku", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/109/Shochiku"}, {"mal_id": 157, "type": "anime", "name": "BMG Japan", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/157/BMG_Japan"}, {"mal_id": 159, "type": "anime", "name": "Kodansha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"}, {"mal_id": 765, "type": "anime", "name": "Sakura Create", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/765/Sakura_Create"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 97, "type": "anime", "name": "ADV Films", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/97/ADV_Films"}, {"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Production I.G", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 7, "type": "anime", "name": "Mystery", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"}, {"mal_id": 37, "type": "anime", "name": "Supernatural", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 13, "type": "anime", "name": "Historical", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 8514, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/8514/Break_Blade_Movie_2__Ketsubetsu_no_Michi", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/68081.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/68081t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/68081l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/68081.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/68081t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/68081l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Break Blade Movie 2: Ketsubetsu no Michi"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Breaker Blade 2"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Break Blade 2: The Split Path"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30af\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30c9 \u8a23\u5225\u30ce\u8def"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Broken Blade 2"}], "title": "Break Blade Movie 2: Ketsubetsu no Michi", "title_english": "Broken Blade 2", "title_japanese": "\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30af\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30c9 \u8a23\u5225\u30ce\u8def", "title_synonyms": ["Breaker Blade 2", "Break Blade 2: The Split Path"], "type": "Movie", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2010-06-26T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 26, "month": 6, "year": 2010}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Jun 26, 2010"}, "duration": "51 min", "rating": "R -

Nevertheless, nothing will stop Kuroitsu from doing her best if it means getting the promotion she desires!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Kaijin Kaihatsu-bu no Kuroitsu-san was released on Blu-ray on June 29, 2022.", "season": "winter", "year": 2022, "broadcast": {"day": "Sundays", "time": "02:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Sundays at 02:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 55, "type": "anime", "name": "TV Asahi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/55/TV_Asahi"}, {"mal_id": 1500, "type": "anime", "name": "ABC Animation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1500/ABC_Animation"}, {"mal_id": 2381, "type": "anime", "name": "Crest", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2381/Crest"}, {"mal_id": 2548, "type": "anime", "name": "ABC Frontier", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2548/ABC_Frontier"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 2314, "type": "anime", "name": "Quad", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2314/Quad"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 82, "type": "anime", "name": "Urban Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/82/Urban_Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 48, "type": "anime", "name": "Workplace", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/48/Workplace"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 3231, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/3231/Gunslinger_Girl__Il_Teatrino", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/16697.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/16697t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/16697l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/16697.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/16697t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/16697l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "msx9MDbNxOs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msx9MDbNxOs", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/msx9MDbNxOs?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/msx9MDbNxOs/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/msx9MDbNxOs/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/msx9MDbNxOs/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/msx9MDbNxOs/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/msx9MDbNxOs/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Gunslinger Girl: Il Teatrino"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Gunslinger Girl 2nd Season"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Gunslinger Girl Second"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30ac\u30f3\u30b9\u30ea\u30f3\u30ac\u30fc \u30ac\u30fc\u30eb -IL TEATRINO-"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Gunslinger Girl: II Teatrino"}], "title": "Gunslinger Girl: Il Teatrino", "title_english": "Gunslinger Girl: II Teatrino", "title_japanese": "\u30ac\u30f3\u30b9\u30ea\u30f3\u30ac\u30fc \u30ac\u30fc\u30eb -IL TEATRINO-", "title_synonyms": ["Gunslinger Girl 2nd Season", "Gunslinger Girl Second"], "type": "TV", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 13, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2008-01-08T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2008-04-01T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 8, "month": 1, "year": 2008}, "to": {"day": 1, "month": 4, "year": 2008}}, "string": "Jan 8, 2008 to Apr 1, 2008"}, "duration": "25 min per ep", "rating": "R - 17+ (violence & profanity)", "score": 7.11, "scored_by": 29024, "rank": 3982, "popularity": 3026, "members": 63211, "favorites": 114, "synopsis": "When the Social Welfare Agency investigates the disappearance of an operative, their inquiry leads them right into the lair of their rival, the Five Republics.

Fittingly, Souya Kuroi wakes up from a nightmare of a massive dragon destroying everything around him in a blaze of rainbow colored light. After being told that he lost his parents and memory in a strange accident, the waking world becomes another nightmare in itself. With this dream being his only memory, he has no choice but to be taken care of by his two strange guardians: the spunky and energetic maid Ginko, and a huge cat known only as \"Sensei.\"\n\nHis new life is turned upside down when the denizens of Saromisaka City are beset by a teddy bear-shaped UFO. When military power proves to be ineffective, seven mysterious people rise up to fight off the monstrosity. These heroes destroy the invader in a flurry of rainbow colored lights, the very same lights that Souya saw in his nightmare.\n\nWith the alien threat repelled, these seven strangers find themselves facing a new adversary: Souya. Swearing vengeance upon the people who decimated his old life, he begins his crusade against these \"heroes\" and becomes embroiled in a struggle of galactic proportions.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "summer", "year": 2018, "broadcast": {"day": "Sundays", "time": "22:30", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Sundays at 22:30 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 166, "type": "anime", "name": "Movic", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"}, {"mal_id": 1287, "type": "anime", "name": "Q-Tec", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1287/Q-Tec"}, {"mal_id": 1333, "type": "anime", "name": "Hakuhodo DY Music & Pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1333/Hakuhodo_DY_Music___Pictures"}, {"mal_id": 1337, "type": "anime", "name": "Medicos Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1337/Medicos_Entertainment"}, {"mal_id": 1416, "type": "anime", "name": "BS11", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1416/BS11"}, {"mal_id": 1840, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai Namco Arts", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1840/Bandai_Namco_Arts"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 467, "type": "anime", "name": "Discotek Media", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/467/Discotek_Media"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 7, "type": "anime", "name": "J.C.Staff", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/7/JCStaff"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 18, "type": "anime", "name": "Mecha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 32561, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/32561/Hai_to_Gensou_no_Grimgar__Furoagari_no_Kabe_ni_Kaketa_Seishun_-_One_More_Centimeter", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/78160.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/78160t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/78160l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/78160.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/78160t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/78160l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "JSILROF4GSY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSILROF4GSY", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/JSILROF4GSY?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/JSILROF4GSY/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/JSILROF4GSY/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/JSILROF4GSY/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/JSILROF4GSY/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/JSILROF4GSY/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Hai to Gensou no Grimgar: Furoagari no Kabe ni Kaketa Seishun -

Alita must now work hard to make sure the kingdom is not trading one royal scandal for another, all while the two displaced women look for a way to return to their original bodies.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 82, "type": "anime", "name": "Marvelous Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/82/Marvelous_Entertainment"}, {"mal_id": 3165, "type": "anime", "name": "Avex Mode", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/3165/Avex_Mode"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 5, "type": "anime", "name": "Bee Train", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/5/Bee_Train"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 58, "type": "anime", "name": "Gore", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/58/Gore"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 142, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/142/Kamikaze_Kaitou_Jeanne", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/20389.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/20389t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/20389l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/20389.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/20389t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/20389l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Kamikaze Kaitou Jeanne"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Phantom Thief Jeanne"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Divine Wind Thief Jeanne"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u795e\u98a8\u602a\u76d7\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30cc"}], "title": "Kamikaze Kaitou Jeanne", "title_english": null, "title_japanese": "\u795e\u98a8\u602a\u76d7\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30cc", "title_synonyms": ["Phantom Thief Jeanne", "Divine Wind Thief Jeanne"], "type": "TV", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 44, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "1999-02-13T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2000-01-29T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 13, "month": 2, "year": 1999}, "to": {"day": 29, "month": 1, "year": 2000}}, "string": "Feb 13, 1999 to Jan 29, 2000"}, "duration": "24 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.47, "scored_by": 29680, "rank": 2130, "popularity": 3111, "members": 60000, "favorites": 556, "synopsis": "A normal looking high school girl on the outside, Kusakabe Maron is actually the reincarnation of Jeanne d' Arc.

Even so, Kai finds solace in making looped beats on his laptop and uploading them to the internet.\n\nDespite his reserved and glum demeanor, Kai is approached by Kunio and Yuuho Ebina, two cheerful classmates that happened upon one of his videos. The pair ask him to join their rock band but are met with apathy. Nevertheless, Kai agrees to accompany them in a practice session on Merfolk Island, where he soon witnesses something that he cannot explain.\n\nLater that night, Kai is composing music in his room when he attracts a familiar entity\u2014a mermaid. As she twirls and grins to the sound of his stereo, Kai discovers a number of aspects about the being who introduces herself as Lu: she possesses incredible water manipulation powers; she buds a pair of functioning legs with the sound of music; but most notably, she is a truly benevolent creature who simply wants people to like her. Fostering a dynamic friendship, Kai and Lu gradually come to express their genuine selves, testing the long-standing boundaries that have deafened the resounding harmony among the people of Hinashi Town.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "In 2017, Yoake Tsugeru Lu no Uta became the first Japanese production in over 22 years to win the \"Cristal for a Feature Film\" award at the 27th Annecy International Animation Film Festival.
