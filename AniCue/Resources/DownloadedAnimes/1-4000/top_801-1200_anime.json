This eclectic group has a long way to go if they wish to succeed and climb the ranks at the Anti-Magic Academy: they must first set aside their differences and come to work together as a team.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Taimadou Gakuen 35 Shiken Shoutai adapts the first 5 novels of Touki Yanagimi's light novel series of the same name, as well as content from the Another Mission side story series.", "season": "fall", "year": 2015, "broadcast": {"day": "Thursdays", "time": "01:05", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Thursdays at 01:05 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 460, "type": "anime", "name": "KlockWorx", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/460/KlockWorx"}, {"mal_id": 963, "type": "anime", "name": "MAGES.", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/963/MAGES"}, {"mal_id": 1255, "type": "anime", "name": "Glovision", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1255/Glovision"}, {"mal_id": 1551, "type": "anime", "name": "Kadokawa Media House", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1551/Kadokawa_Media_House"}, {"mal_id": 1696, "type": "anime", "name": "Kadokawa", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"}, {"mal_id": 2035, "type": "anime", "name": "Heiwa", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2035/Heiwa"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 467, "type": "anime", "name": "Discotek Media", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/467/Discotek_Media"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 300, "type": "anime", "name": "SILVER LINK.", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/300/SILVER_LINK"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}, {"mal_id": 9, "type": "anime", "name": "Ecchi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/9/Ecchi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 35, "type": "anime", "name": "Harem", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/35/Harem"}, {"mal_id": 38, "type": "anime", "name": "Military", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"}, {"mal_id": 82, "type": "anime", "name": "Urban Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/82/Urban_Fantasy"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 21557, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/21557/Omoide_no_Marnie", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/64293.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/64293t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/64293l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/64293.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/64293t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/64293l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "jjmrxqcQdYg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjmrxqcQdYg", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/jjmrxqcQdYg?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/jjmrxqcQdYg/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/jjmrxqcQdYg/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/jjmrxqcQdYg/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/jjmrxqcQdYg/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/jjmrxqcQdYg/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Omoide no Marnie"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u601d\u3044\u51fa\u306e\u30de\u30fc\u30cb\u30fc"}, {"type": "English", "title": "When Marnie Was There"}, {"type": "German", "title": "Erinnerungen an Marnie"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "El Recuerdo de Marnie"}, {"type": "French", "title": "Souvenirs de Marnie"}], "title": "Omoide no Marnie", "title_english": "When Marnie Was There", "title_japanese": "\u601d\u3044\u51fa\u306e\u30de\u30fc\u30cb\u30fc", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "Movie", "source": "Novel", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2014-07-19T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 19, "month": 7, "year": 2014}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Jul 19, 2014"}, "duration": "1 hr 42 min", "rating": "G - All Ages", "score": 8.04, "scored_by": 177806, "rank": 633, "popularity": 817, "members": 324209, "favorites": 2830, "synopsis": "Suffering from frequent asthma attacks, young Anna Sasaki is quiet, unsociable, and isolated from her peers, causing her foster parent endless worry.

Even more baffling is that the other tenants of Yuragi-sou not only are able to see Yuuna as well, but each has their own supernatural ability.\n\nAmidst the chaos caused by his quirky fellow residents, Kogarashi attempts to uncover the regret that keeps Yuuna anchored to the world of the living, lest she become an evil spirit sentenced to spend her afterlife in hell.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "summer", "year": 2018, "broadcast": {"day": "Saturdays", "time": "23:30", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Saturdays at 23:30 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 17, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"}, {"mal_id": 1365, "type": "anime", "name": "Shueisha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1365/Shueisha"}, {"mal_id": 1416, "type": "anime", "name": "BS11", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1416/BS11"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 493, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex of America", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/493/Aniplex_of_America"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Xebec", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/27/Xebec"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}, {"mal_id": 37, "type": "anime", "name": "Supernatural", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}, {"mal_id": 9, "type": "anime", "name": "Ecchi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/9/Ecchi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 35, "type": "anime", "name": "Harem", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/35/Harem"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]}, {"mal_id": 27655, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/27655/AldnoahZero_Part_2", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/71297.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/71297t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/71297l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/71297.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/71297t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/71297l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "AEn7nqWONC0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEn7nqWONC0", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/AEn7nqWONC0?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/AEn7nqWONC0/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/AEn7nqWONC0/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/AEn7nqWONC0/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/AEn7nqWONC0/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/AEn7nqWONC0/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Aldnoah.Zero Part 2"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Aldnoah.Zero 2nd Season"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30a2\u30eb\u30c9\u30ce\u30a2\u30fb\u30bc\u30ed\uff08\u7b2c2\u30af\u30fc\u30eb\uff09"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Aldnoah.Zero Part 2"}, {"type": "German", "title": "Aldnoah.Zero Saison 2"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "Aldnoah.Zero Temporada 2"}, {"type": "French", "title": "Aldnoah.Zero Saison 2"}], "title": "Aldnoah.Zero Part 2", "title_english": "Aldnoah.Zero Part 2", "title_japanese": "\u30a2\u30eb\u30c9\u30ce\u30a2\u30fb\u30bc\u30ed\uff08\u7b2c2\u30af\u30fc\u30eb\uff09", "title_synonyms": ["Aldnoah.Zero 2nd Season"], "type": "TV", "source": "Original", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2015-01-11T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2015-03-29T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 11, "month": 1, "year": 2015}, "to": {"day": 29, "month": 3, "year": 2015}}, "string": "Jan 11, 2015 to Mar 29, 2015"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "R - 17+ (violence & profanity)", "score": 6.91, "scored_by": 197368, "rank": 4893, "popularity": 830, "members": 320654, "favorites": 759, "synopsis": "The war between the Terrans and the Vers Empire of Mars has ended, allowing humanity to blissfully enjoy their lives in a time of peace.

As the girls fight over who should take care of Akito, they display various eroticisms that may be a little too much for a normal man to handle.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "fall", "year": 2012, "broadcast": {"day": "Fridays", "time": "23:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Fridays at 23:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 104, "type": "anime", "name": "Lantis", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/104/Lantis"}, {"mal_id": 108, "type": "anime", "name": "Media Factory", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/108/Media_Factory"}, {"mal_id": 238, "type": "anime", "name": "AT-X", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"}, {"mal_id": 315, "type": "anime", "name": "DAX Production", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/315/DAX_Production"}, {"mal_id": 619, "type": "anime", "name": "Cospa", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/619/Cospa"}, {"mal_id": 737, "type": "anime", "name": "Sony Music Communications", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/737/Sony_Music_Communications"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 300, "type": "anime", "name": "SILVER LINK.", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/300/SILVER_LINK"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}, {"mal_id": 9, "type": "anime", "name": "Ecchi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/9/Ecchi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 35, "type": "anime", "name": "Harem", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/35/Harem"}, {"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 36286, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/36286/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu_-_Memory_Snow", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1081/95707.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1081/95707t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1081/95707l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1081/95707.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1081/95707t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1081/95707l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "HI3JBI5pENg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI3JBI5pENg", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/HI3JBI5pENg?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/HI3JBI5pENg/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/HI3JBI5pENg/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/HI3JBI5pENg/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/HI3JBI5pENg/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/HI3JBI5pENg/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu - Memory Snow"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Re: Life in a different world from zero"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "ReZero"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu OVA"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "Re:\u30bc\u30ed\u304b\u3089\u59cb\u3081\u308b\u7570\u4e16\u754c\u751f\u6d3b Memory Snow"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World- Memory Snow"}], "title": "Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu - Memory Snow", "title_english": "Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World- Memory Snow", "title_japanese": "Re:\u30bc\u30ed\u304b\u3089\u59cb\u3081\u308b\u7570\u4e16\u754c\u751f\u6d3b Memory Snow", "title_synonyms": ["Re: Life in a different world from zero", "ReZero", "Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu OVA"], "type": "Movie", "source": "Light novel", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2018-10-06T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 6, "month": 10, "year": 2018}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Oct 6, 2018"}, "duration": "1 hr", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.58, "scored_by": 169029, "rank": 1717, "popularity": 837, "members": 319188, "favorites": 688, "synopsis": "Subaru Natsuki finally gets to take a breather, but he does not waste any time as he prepares for a date with his beloved Emilia.

Completely caught up in hilarious antics with his new friends, Yuiga finds that his last year of high school now includes a lot more than just going to class and studying.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "fall", "year": 2019, "broadcast": {"day": "Sundays", "time": "00:30", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Sundays at 00:30 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 17, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"}, {"mal_id": 166, "type": "anime", "name": "Movic", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"}, {"mal_id": 306, "type": "anime", "name": "Magic Capsule", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/306/Magic_Capsule"}, {"mal_id": 1365, "type": "anime", "name": "Shueisha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1365/Shueisha"}, {"mal_id": 1416, "type": "anime", "name": "BS11", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1416/BS11"}, {"mal_id": 2101, "type": "anime", "name": "ADK", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2101/ADK"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 493, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex of America", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/493/Aniplex_of_America"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 1873, "type": "anime", "name": "Silver", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1873/Silver"}, {"mal_id": 1874, "type": "anime", "name": "Arvo Animation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1874/Arvo_Animation"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 35, "type": "anime", "name": "Harem", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/35/Harem"}, {"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]}, {"mal_id": 36470, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/36470/Tada-kun_wa_Koi_wo_Shinai", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1446/91841.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1446/91841t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1446/91841l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1446/91841.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1446/91841t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1446/91841l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "4LCOgIeRCh0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LCOgIeRCh0", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/4LCOgIeRCh0?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/4LCOgIeRCh0/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/4LCOgIeRCh0/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/4LCOgIeRCh0/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/4LCOgIeRCh0/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/4LCOgIeRCh0/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Tada-kun wa Koi wo Shinai"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Tada Doesn't Fall in Love"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "TadaKoi"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u591a\u7530\u304f\u3093\u306f\u604b\u3092\u3057\u306a\u3044"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Tada Never Falls in Love"}], "title": "Tada-kun wa Koi wo Shinai", "title_english": "Tada Never Falls in Love", "title_japanese": "\u591a\u7530\u304f\u3093\u306f\u604b\u3092\u3057\u306a\u3044", "title_synonyms": ["Tada Doesn't Fall in Love", "TadaKoi"], "type": "TV", "source": "Original", "episodes": 13, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2018-04-05T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2018-06-28T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 5, "month": 4, "year": 2018}, "to": {"day": 28, "month": 6, "year": 2018}}, "string": "Apr 5, 2018 to Jun 28, 2018"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.57, "scored_by": 138034, "rank": 1748, "popularity": 844, "members": 318402, "favorites": 1425, "synopsis": "Love has never really been a concern for Mitsuyoshi Tada, and as the aspiring photographer enters his second year of high school, it truthfully could not be further from his mind.

Shinozaki tries to assure her that her studies into such subjects aren't necessary, but Kousaka devotes herself to making him happy in more ways than one.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "fall", "year": 2017, "broadcast": {"day": "Thursdays", "time": "00:30", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Thursdays at 00:30 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 238, "type": "anime", "name": "AT-X", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"}, {"mal_id": 323, "type": "anime", "name": "Nippon Columbia", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/323/Nippon_Columbia"}, {"mal_id": 460, "type": "anime", "name": "KlockWorx", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/460/KlockWorx"}, {"mal_id": 737, "type": "anime", "name": "Sony Music Communications", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/737/Sony_Music_Communications"}, {"mal_id": 882, "type": "anime", "name": "Toranoana", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/882/Toranoana"}, {"mal_id": 1255, "type": "anime", "name": "Glovision", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1255/Glovision"}, {"mal_id": 1345, "type": "anime", "name": "Sammy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1345/Sammy"}, {"mal_id": 1551, "type": "anime", "name": "Kadokawa Media House", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1551/Kadokawa_Media_House"}, {"mal_id": 1651, "type": "anime", "name": "Production Ace", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1651/Production_Ace"}, {"mal_id": 1696, "type": "anime", "name": "Kadokawa", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 376, "type": "anime", "name": "Sentai Filmworks", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 51, "type": "anime", "name": "Diomed\u00e9a", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/51/Diomed%C3%A9a"}, {"mal_id": 478, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio Blanc.", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/478/Studio_Blanc"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}, {"mal_id": 9, "type": "anime", "name": "Ecchi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/9/Ecchi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 35, "type": "anime", "name": "Harem", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/35/Harem"}, {"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 4975, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/4975/Ch\u00e4oS_HEAd", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/15443.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/15443t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/15443l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/15443.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/15443t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/15443l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "ChaoS,HEAd"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30ab\u30aa\u30b9\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd"}], "title": "Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd", "title_english": "Ch\u00e4oS;HEAd", "title_japanese": "\u30ab\u30aa\u30b9\u30d8\u30c3\u30c9", "title_synonyms": ["ChaoS,HEAd"], "type": "TV", "source": "Visual novel", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2008-10-09T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2008-12-25T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 9, "month": 10, "year": 2008}, "to": {"day": 25, "month": 12, "year": 2008}}, "string": "Oct 9, 2008 to Dec 25, 2008"}, "duration": "27 min per ep", "rating": "R - 17+ (violence & profanity)", "score": 6.28, "scored_by": 156043, "rank": 8592, "popularity": 908, "members": 294666, "favorites": 745, "synopsis": "Throughout Shibuya, a series of murders dubbed the \"New Generation Madness\" gained widespread attention As these crimes gained infamy, they became a hot topic of discussion among the people of the area.

The movie was released in theaters on July 30, 2011, earning 840 million yen in box office revenue. The DVD version was made available on April 27, 2012 in Japan. Neon Alley began streaming the film on January 26, 2014 and Viz Media released it on DVD and Blu-ray in North America on February 18, 2014. While the previous movies were produced with the participation of the television series' screenplay writers, Naruto: Shippuuden Movie 5 - Blood Prison was entrusted to the mystery writer Akira Higashiyama.

Vowing to reinstate the Dark Realm to its former glory, Jahy continues her journey to reassemble the mana crystal.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Jahy-sama wa Kujikenai! was released on Blu-ray in five volumes from December 22, 2021 to April 27, 2022.", "season": "summer", "year": 2021, "broadcast": {"day": "Sundays", "time": "02:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Sundays at 02:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 58, "type": "anime", "name": "Square Enix", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/58/Square_Enix"}, {"mal_id": 1337, "type": "anime", "name": "Medicos Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1337/Medicos_Entertainment"}, {"mal_id": 1344, "type": "anime", "name": "King Records", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1344/King_Records"}, {"mal_id": 1366, "type": "anime", "name": "Nagoya Broadcasting Network", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1366/Nagoya_Broadcasting_Network"}, {"mal_id": 1500, "type": "anime", "name": "ABC Animation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1500/ABC_Animation"}, {"mal_id": 1671, "type": "anime", "name": "DMM pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1671/DMM_pictures"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 300, "type": "anime", "name": "SILVER LINK.", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/300/SILVER_LINK"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 37, "type": "anime", "name": "Supernatural", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]}, {"mal_id": 51462, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/51462/Isekai_Nonbiri_Nouka", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1983/132329.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1983/132329t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1983/132329l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1983/132329.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1983/132329t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1983/132329l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "iwxPf8SEmEU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwxPf8SEmEU", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/iwxPf8SEmEU?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/iwxPf8SEmEU/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/iwxPf8SEmEU/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/iwxPf8SEmEU/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/iwxPf8SEmEU/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/iwxPf8SEmEU/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Isekai Nonbiri Nouka"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u7570\u4e16\u754c\u306e\u3093\u3073\u308a\u8fb2\u5bb6"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Farming Life in Another World"}], "title": "Isekai Nonbiri Nouka", "title_english": "Farming Life in Another World", "title_japanese": "\u7570\u4e16\u754c\u306e\u3093\u3073\u308a\u8fb2\u5bb6", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "TV", "source": "Light novel", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2023-01-06T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2023-03-24T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 6, "month": 1, "year": 2023}, "to": {"day": 24, "month": 3, "year": 2023}}, "string": "Jan 6, 2023 to Mar 24, 2023"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.54, "scored_by": 132783, "rank": 1854, "popularity": 1021, "members": 262635, "favorites": 2073, "synopsis": "During the final years of his life, Hiraku Machio remained confined to a hospital bed with a terminal illness until he finally passed away.

However, as time passes by, will Ichika remain repulsed by Ryou's creepy yet dedicated advances?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 2021, "broadcast": {"day": "Mondays", "time": "22:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Mondays at 22:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 843, "type": "anime", "name": "BS Fuji", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/843/BS_Fuji"}, {"mal_id": 1221, "type": "anime", "name": "Hokkaido Cultural Broadcasting", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1221/Hokkaido_Cultural_Broadcasting"}, {"mal_id": 1401, "type": "anime", "name": "Amusement Media Academy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1401/Amusement_Media_Academy"}, {"mal_id": 1582, "type": "anime", "name": "Ichijinsha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1582/Ichijinsha"}, {"mal_id": 1677, "type": "anime", "name": "Kanetsu Investment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1677/Kanetsu_Investment"}, {"mal_id": 1858, "type": "anime", "name": "Sonilude", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1858/Sonilude"}, {"mal_id": 1985, "type": "anime", "name": "Toyo Recording", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1985/Toyo_Recording"}, {"mal_id": 2144, "type": "anime", "name": "BloomZ", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2144/BloomZ"}, {"mal_id": 2221, "type": "anime", "name": "AMG Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2221/AMG_Entertainment"}, {"mal_id": 2222, "type": "anime", "name": "MediaNet Pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2222/MediaNet_Pictures"}, {"mal_id": 2223, "type": "anime", "name": "Christmas Holly", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2223/Christmas_Holly"}, {"mal_id": 2224, "type": "anime", "name": "Miyazaki Broadcasting", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2224/Miyazaki_Broadcasting"}, {"mal_id": 2225, "type": "anime", "name": "C-one", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2225/C-one"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 70, "type": "anime", "name": "Nomad", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/70/Nomad"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 48585, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/48585/Black_Clover__Mahou_Tei_no_Ken", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1337/136363.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1337/136363t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1337/136363l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1337/136363.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1337/136363t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1337/136363l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "EZOToP8xLPg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZOToP8xLPg", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/EZOToP8xLPg?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/EZOToP8xLPg/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/EZOToP8xLPg/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/EZOToP8xLPg/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/EZOToP8xLPg/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/EZOToP8xLPg/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Black Clover: Mahou Tei no Ken"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Black Clover: Mahoutei no Ken"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc \u9b54\u6cd5\u5e1d\u306e\u5263"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Black Clover: Sword of the Wizard King"}], "title": "Black Clover: Mahou Tei no Ken", "title_english": "Black Clover: Sword of the Wizard King", "title_japanese": "\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc \u9b54\u6cd5\u5e1d\u306e\u5263", "title_synonyms": ["Black Clover: Mahoutei no Ken"], "type": "Movie", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2023-06-16T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 16, "month": 6, "year": 2023}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Jun 16, 2023"}, "duration": "1 hr 53 min", "rating": "PG-13 -

She wants nothing more than to be the center of attention and praise\u2014which is why she cannot stand Souichirou Arima, the male representative for her class and the only person more perfect than her. Since the first day of high school, she has struggled to steal the spotlight from her new rival but to no avail.\n\nAt last, on the midterm exams, Yukino gets the top score and beats Souichirou. But, to her surprise, he congratulates her on her achievement, leading her to question her deceptive lifestyle. When Souichirou confesses his love to Yukino, she turns him down and gloats about it at home with only a hint of regret. But the very next day, Souichirou visits Yukino house to bring her a CD and sees her uninhibited self in action; now equipped with the truth, he blackmails her into completing his student council duties. Coerced into spending time with Souichirou, Yukino learns that she is not the only one hiding secrets.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "fall", "year": 1998, "broadcast": {"day": "Fridays", "time": "18:30", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Fridays at 18:30 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 16, "type": "anime", "name": "TV Tokyo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"}, {"mal_id": 153, "type": "anime", "name": "SoftX", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/153/SoftX"}, {"mal_id": 721, "type": "anime", "name": "GANSIS", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/721/GANSIS"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 217, "type": "anime", "name": "Nozomi Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/217/Nozomi_Entertainment"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 6, "type": "anime", "name": "Gainax", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/6/Gainax"}, {"mal_id": 7, "type": "anime", "name": "J.C.Staff", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/7/JCStaff"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 25, "type": "anime", "name": "Shoujo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo"}]}, {"mal_id": 10568, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/10568/Kamisama_no_Memochou", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/75202.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/75202t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/75202l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/75202.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/75202t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/75202l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "5qWB11LIwmE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qWB11LIwmE", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/5qWB11LIwmE?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/5qWB11LIwmE/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/5qWB11LIwmE/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/5qWB11LIwmE/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/5qWB11LIwmE/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/5qWB11LIwmE/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Kamisama no Memochou"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "It's the Only NEET Thing to Do"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Kami-sama no Memo-chou"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Kami-sama no Memo-chou"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "God's Notebook"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Notebook of God"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u795e\u69d8\u306e\u30e1\u30e2\u5e33"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Heaven's Memo Pad"}], "title": "Kamisama no Memochou", "title_english": "Heaven's Memo Pad", "title_japanese": "\u795e\u69d8\u306e\u30e1\u30e2\u5e33", "title_synonyms": ["It's the Only NEET Thing to Do", "Kami-sama no Memo-chou", "Kami-sama no Memo-chou", "God's Notebook", "Notebook of God"], "type": "TV", "source": "Light novel", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2011-07-02T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2011-09-24T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 2, "month": 7, "year": 2011}, "to": {"day": 24, "month": 9, "year": 2011}}, "string": "Jul 2, 2011 to Sep 24, 2011"}, "duration": "26 min per ep", "rating": "R - 17+ (violence & profanity)", "score": 7.46, "scored_by": 97440, "rank": 2183, "popularity": 1084, "members": 246926, "favorites": 804, "synopsis": "Narumi Fujishima may seem like a normal high school student at first glance, but in reality he is a pessimistic outsider.

Over the years since the existence of Mato was first confirmed, incidents of people accidentally wandering into the other world have become commonplace. To combat the threat of the Shuuki and rescue victims like Yuuki, the all-female Demon Defense Force was established. Its members have been blessed with the power of \"Peaches\"\u2014Mato fruits that grant supernatural abilities only to women.\n\nThough Yuuki's situation is dire, he is saved in the nick of time by Kyouka Uzen, the chief of the Demon Defense Force's seventh unit.

Slave allows Kyouka to put a living being under her control and draw out its strength, but the Shuuki that she had enslaved until now had all proven to be exceedingly weak.\n\nWhen Yuuki and Kyouka become surrounded by a horde of Shuuki, Kyouka resorts to something she has never tried before: using her ability on a man. To her surprise, Yuuki's slave form is much more powerful than she could have imagined. Believing the young man to be the key to unlocking her true potential, Kyouka invites Yuuki to join the Demon Defense Force\u2014but not as a regular member.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Mato Seihei no Slave was released on Blu-ray in three volumes from April 17, 2024, to June 19, 2024.", "season": "winter", "year": 2024, "broadcast": {"day": "Thursdays", "time": "23:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Thursdays at 23:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 144, "type": "anime", "name": "Pony Canyon", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/144/Pony_Canyon"}, {"mal_id": 238, "type": "anime", "name": "AT-X", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"}, {"mal_id": 1996, "type": "anime", "name": "MAGNET", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1996/MAGNET"}, {"mal_id": 2634, "type": "anime", "name": "Yostar", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2634/Yostar"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 376, "type": "anime", "name": "Sentai Filmworks", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 35, "type": "anime", "name": "Seven Arcs", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/35/Seven_Arcs"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 9, "type": "anime", "name": "Ecchi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/9/Ecchi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 35, "type": "anime", "name": "Harem", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/35/Harem"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]}, {"mal_id": 50549, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/50549/Bubble", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1011/121152.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1011/121152t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1011/121152l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1011/121152.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1011/121152t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1011/121152l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "44eINOdC3MA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44eINOdC3MA", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/44eINOdC3MA?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/44eINOdC3MA/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/44eINOdC3MA/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/44eINOdC3MA/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/44eINOdC3MA/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/44eINOdC3MA/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Bubble"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30d0\u30d6\u30eb"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Bubble"}], "title": "Bubble", "title_english": "Bubble", "title_japanese": "\u30d0\u30d6\u30eb", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "ONA", "source": "Original", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2022-04-28T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 28, "month": 4, "year": 2022}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Apr 28, 2022"}, "duration": "1 hr 40 min", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.24, "scored_by": 129284, "rank": 3226, "popularity": 1145, "members": 234822, "favorites": 1555, "synopsis": "Five years ago, gravity-defying bubbles with mysterious powers rained down upon the earth.

Now with the two reunited after several years of separation, the reestablishment of their relationship is marked by Takano's vow to make Ritsu say that he loves him again.\n\nSekaiichi Hatsukoi follows three couples that are interconnected within the manga industry, with each being subject to the budding of first love. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 2011, "broadcast": {"day": "Saturdays", "time": "01:05", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Saturdays at 01:05 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 104, "type": "anime", "name": "Lantis", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/104/Lantis"}, {"mal_id": 113, "type": "anime", "name": "Kadokawa Shoten", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/113/Kadokawa_Shoten"}, {"mal_id": 238, "type": "anime", "name": "AT-X", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"}, {"mal_id": 315, "type": "anime", "name": "DAX Production", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/315/DAX_Production"}, {"mal_id": 460, "type": "anime", "name": "KlockWorx", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/460/KlockWorx"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 37, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio Deen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/37/Studio_Deen"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 28, "type": "anime", "name": "Boys Love", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/28/Boys_Love"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 50, "type": "anime", "name": "Adult Cast", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"}, {"mal_id": 69, "type": "anime", "name": "Otaku Culture", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/69/Otaku_Culture"}, {"mal_id": 48, "type": "anime", "name": "Workplace", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/48/Workplace"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 37989, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/37989/Golden_Kamuy_2nd_Season", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1180/95018.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1180/95018t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1180/95018l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1180/95018.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1180/95018t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1180/95018l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "2PDY8LgeS-o", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PDY8LgeS-o", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/2PDY8LgeS-o?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/2PDY8LgeS-o/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/2PDY8LgeS-o/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/2PDY8LgeS-o/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/2PDY8LgeS-o/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/2PDY8LgeS-o/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Golden Kamuy 2nd Season"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Golden Kamuy Second Season"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30b4\u30fc\u30eb\u30c7\u30f3\u30ab\u30e0\u30a4"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Golden Kamuy Season 2"}, {"type": "German", "title": "Golden Kamui Staffel 2"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "Golden Kamuy Temporada 2"}, {"type": "French", "title": "Golden Kamui Saison 2"}], "title": "Golden Kamuy 2nd Season", "title_english": "Golden Kamuy Season 2", "title_japanese": "\u30b4\u30fc\u30eb\u30c7\u30f3\u30ab\u30e0\u30a4", "title_synonyms": ["Golden Kamuy Second Season"], "type": "TV", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2018-10-08T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2018-12-24T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 8, "month": 10, "year": 2018}, "to": {"day": 24, "month": 12, "year": 2018}}, "string": "Oct 8, 2018 to Dec 24, 2018"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "R - 17+ (violence & profanity)", "score": 8.24, "scored_by": 123285, "rank": 353, "popularity": 1192, "members": 226376, "favorites": 1005, "synopsis": "In Hokkaido, it is rumored that there is a stash of hidden gold.
