After the show, Himari blurts out her love, but Yori is inexperienced when it comes to romance.\n\nYori, who did not expect this outcome at all, looks for answers from her friends and music. She decides to respond to Himari's confession, and to her surprise, Yori discovers that Himari fell in love with her music and performance rather than Yori as a person.\n\nDespite the shock, Yori desires to make Himari truly fall in love with her. The duo spend time together after school on the rooftop, where Yori usually plays her guitar with hopes to change Himari's feelings for her.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "The broadcast was delayed following its eighth episode on June 2, 2024 until June 23, 2024.

The only way to win is by knocking out the opponent. Akira, a young man isolated from his family, is known to be undefeatable at Bl@ster. However, his life on the top is shattered when he is accused of murder.

The exemplary troublemaker has done it all and has no plans to stop anytime soon.\n\nCrayon Shin-chan follows the daily shenanigans of Shin-chan with his group of friends, parading around as the self-proclaimed \"Kasukabe Defense Force.\" The adults witnessing these shenanigans unfold can't help but adore Shin-chan, as he keeps them entertained while unintentionally solving their daily troubles through his mindless antics\u2014leaving himself as the only problem they do not know what to do with.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "The first English dubbed version was produced with many famous voice actors through 2001\u20132002 by Vitello Productions.

With this partnership set in stone, the two embark on a perilous journey of bloodshed, vengeance, and redemption, each to fulfill their own life's cause.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 139, "type": "anime", "name": "Nihon Ad Systems", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/139/Nihon_Ad_Systems"}, {"mal_id": 143, "type": "anime", "name": "Mainichi Broadcasting System", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"}, {"mal_id": 144, "type": "anime", "name": "Pony Canyon", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/144/Pony_Canyon"}, {"mal_id": 159, "type": "anime", "name": "Kodansha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 376, "type": "anime", "name": "Sentai Filmworks", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 839, "type": "anime", "name": "LIDENFILMS", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/839/LIDENFILMS"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 37, "type": "anime", "name": "Supernatural", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 58, "type": "anime", "name": "Gore", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/58/Gore"}, {"mal_id": 13, "type": "anime", "name": "Historical", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}, {"mal_id": 17, "type": "anime", "name": "Martial Arts", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/17/Martial_Arts"}, {"mal_id": 21, "type": "anime", "name": "Samurai", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/21/Samurai"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 42, "type": "anime", "name": "Seinen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]}, {"mal_id": 81, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/81/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam__Dai_08_MS_Shoutai", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/75618.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/75618t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/75618l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/75618.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/75618t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/75618l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "HJVC_d1tMLc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJVC_d1tMLc", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/HJVC_d1tMLc?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/HJVC_d1tMLc/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/HJVC_d1tMLc/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/HJVC_d1tMLc/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/HJVC_d1tMLc/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/HJVC_d1tMLc/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Kidou Senshi Gundam: Dai 08 MS Shoutai"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Kidou Senshi Gundam: Dai 08 MS Shotai"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u6a5f\u52d5\u6226\u58eb\u30ac\u30f3\u30c0\u30e0 \u7b2c08MS\u5c0f\u968a"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team"}], "title": "Kidou Senshi Gundam: Dai 08 MS Shoutai", "title_english": "Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team", "title_japanese": "\u6a5f\u52d5\u6226\u58eb\u30ac\u30f3\u30c0\u30e0 \u7b2c08MS\u5c0f\u968a", "title_synonyms": ["Kidou Senshi Gundam: Dai 08 MS Shotai"], "type": "OVA", "source": "Original", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "1996-01-25T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "1999-07-25T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 25, "month": 1, "year": 1996}, "to": {"day": 25, "month": 7, "year": 1999}}, "string": "Jan 25, 1996 to Jul 25, 1999"}, "duration": "24 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.99, "scored_by": 50058, "rank": 700, "popularity": 2434, "members": 91149, "favorites": 1181, "synopsis": "In year 0079 of the Universal Century, the Earth Federation initiates Operation Odessa\u2014a full-scale assault to retake a major Ukrainian city from the Principality of Zeon.

As the return to her past hobby starts to bring her out of her shell, Aoi finds herself gaining close friends, taking on new challenges, and continuing to find her own encouragement to climb.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Yama no Susume adapts the 1st volume and part of the 2nd volume of siro's manga series of the same title.", "season": "winter", "year": 2013, "broadcast": {"day": "Thursdays", "time": "01:30", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Thursdays at 01:30 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 925, "type": "anime", "name": "Earth Star Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/925/Earth_Star_Entertainment"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 441, "type": "anime", "name": "8bit", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/441/8bit"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 36, "type": "anime", "name": "Slice of Life", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 52, "type": "anime", "name": "CGDCT", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/52/CGDCT"}, {"mal_id": 63, "type": "anime", "name": "Iyashikei", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/63/Iyashikei"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 59205, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/59205/Clevatess__Majuu_no_Ou_to_Akago_to_Shikabane_no_Yuusha", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1255/150593.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1255/150593t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1255/150593l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1255/150593.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1255/150593t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1255/150593l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "sX4o5OODMqQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX4o5OODMqQ", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/sX4o5OODMqQ?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/sX4o5OODMqQ/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/sX4o5OODMqQ/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/sX4o5OODMqQ/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/sX4o5OODMqQ/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/sX4o5OODMqQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Clevatess: Majuu no Ou to Akago to Shikabane no Yuusha"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Clevatess: The King of Devil Beasts"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "The Baby and the Brave of Undead"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30af\u30ec\u30d0\u30c6\u30b9-\u9b54\u7363\u306e\u738b\u3068\u8d64\u5b50\u3068\u5c4d\u306e\u52c7\u8005-"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Clevatess"}], "title": "Clevatess: Majuu no Ou to Akago to Shikabane no Yuusha", "title_english": "Clevatess", "title_japanese": "\u30af\u30ec\u30d0\u30c6\u30b9-\u9b54\u7363\u306e\u738b\u3068\u8d64\u5b50\u3068\u5c4d\u306e\u52c7\u8005-", "title_synonyms": ["Clevatess: The King of Devil Beasts", "The Baby and the Brave of Undead"], "type": "TV", "source": "Web manga", "episodes": 12, "status": "Currently Airing", "airing": true, "aired": {"from": "2025-07-02T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2025-09-17T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 2, "month": 7, "year": 2025}, "to": {"day": 17, "month": 9, "year": 2025}}, "string": "Jul 2, 2025 to Sep 17, 2025"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "R - 17+ (violence & profanity)", "score": 7.88, "scored_by": 14816, "rank": 890, "popularity": 2447, "members": 90642, "favorites": 294, "synopsis": "Alicia, who had dreamed of becoming a hero since childhood, is chosen by the king as one of the thirteen heroes.

As Chihiro's neatfreak instincts kick in, he sets about cleaning the entire residence.\n\nShounen Maid is a lighthearted comedy that follows Chihiro as he finds himself dressed in a frilly uniform (handmade by his uncle), receiving a salary, and working as maid of the house.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 2016, "broadcast": {"day": "Fridays", "time": "01:58", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Fridays at 01:58 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 113, "type": "anime", "name": "Kadokawa Shoten", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/113/Kadokawa_Shoten"}, {"mal_id": 145, "type": "anime", "name": "TBS", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/145/TBS"}, {"mal_id": 315, "type": "anime", "name": "DAX Production", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/315/DAX_Production"}, {"mal_id": 323, "type": "anime", "name": "Nippon Columbia", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/323/Nippon_Columbia"}, {"mal_id": 737, "type": "anime", "name": "Sony Music Communications", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/737/Sony_Music_Communications"}, {"mal_id": 1496, "type": "anime", "name": "Lawson", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1496/Lawson"}, {"mal_id": 1589, "type": "anime", "name": "NichiNare", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1589/NichiNare"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 441, "type": "anime", "name": "8bit", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/441/8bit"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 36, "type": "anime", "name": "Slice of Life", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 63, "type": "anime", "name": "Iyashikei", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/63/Iyashikei"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 25, "type": "anime", "name": "Shoujo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo"}]}, {"mal_id": 31456, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/31456/Code_Realize_-_Sousei_no_Himegimi", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/88465.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/88465t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/88465l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/88465.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/88465t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/88465l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "py_bKtAn6tE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=py_bKtAn6tE", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/py_bKtAn6tE?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/py_bKtAn6tE/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/py_bKtAn6tE/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/py_bKtAn6tE/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/py_bKtAn6tE/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/py_bKtAn6tE/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Code:Realize - Sousei no Himegimi"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "Code:Realize \uff5e\u5275\u4e16\u306e\u59eb\u541b\uff5e"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Code:Realize ~Guardian of Rebirth~"}, {"type": "German", "title": "Code: Realize ~Guardian of Rebirth~"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "Code: Realize -Guardian of Rebirth-"}, {"type": "French", "title": "Code:Realize - Guardian of Rebirth"}], "title": "Code:Realize - Sousei no Himegimi", "title_english": "Code:Realize ~Guardian of Rebirth~", "title_japanese": "Code:Realize \uff5e\u5275\u4e16\u306e\u59eb\u541b\uff5e", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "TV", "source": "Visual novel", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2017-10-07T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2017-12-23T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 7, "month": 10, "year": 2017}, "to": {"day": 23, "month": 12, "year": 2017}}, "string": "Oct 7, 2017 to Dec 23, 2017"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 6.66, "scored_by": 28405, "rank": 6310, "popularity": 2470, "members": 89073, "favorites": 277, "synopsis": "Within Cardia Beckford's hazy memories, she can recall her father Isaac and the home where she lives alone, feared as a monster by the townsfolk\u2014for in her body, she carries a deadly substance.

But Doctor Victor Frankenstein, who vanished shortly after his revolutionary work on corpse reanimation, is said to have revived the only corpse in possession of a soul.\n\nIn pursuit of this scientific knowledge, London medical student John Watson hopes to fulfill his promise to his late partner, Friday.

The clan was known as the Manyuu, and the skill was the ability to administer a sword strike that could shrink the size of a woman's breasts. This might not seem like an ability that could exert power over a land, but in Manyuu Hikenchou, large breasts denote status, wealth, fame, and influence.\n\nGrave concern has arisen in the Manyuu clan due to the actions of their chosen successor, Chifusa. Disgusted with the breast obsessed society that the Manyuu have created and perpetuated, Chifusa has not only deserted the clan, but also stolen the sacred scroll that details their techniques to growing and severing breasts.\n\nFortunately, Chifusa is not completely alone. Her fellow warrior Kaede is sympathetic to her cause; a sympathy that could place her in considerable danger. Now wanted by the very clan that raised her, Chifusa must defend her life and Kaede's while seeking to undo the damage their brethren have done to the land. Along the way, Chifusa will discover that she harbors a power that goes far beyond the scope of her training, one that could help shape and change the land that she seeks to bring equality to.", "background": "", "season": "summer", "year": 2011, "broadcast": {"day": "Mondays", "time": "01:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Mondays at 01:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 16, "type": "anime", "name": "TV Tokyo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"}, {"mal_id": 104, "type": "anime", "name": "Lantis", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/104/Lantis"}, {"mal_id": 392, "type": "anime", "name": "Enterbrain", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/392/Enterbrain"}, {"mal_id": 647, "type": "anime", "name": "Memory-Tech", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/647/Memory-Tech"}, {"mal_id": 787, "type": "anime", "name": "Happinet Pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/787/Happinet_Pictures"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 346, "type": "anime", "name": "Hoods Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/346/Hoods_Entertainment"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 9, "type": "anime", "name": "Ecchi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/9/Ecchi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 13, "type": "anime", "name": "Historical", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}, {"mal_id": 21, "type": "anime", "name": "Samurai", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/21/Samurai"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 42, "type": "anime", "name": "Seinen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]}, {"mal_id": 190, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/190/Love_Hina_Again", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/10289.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/10289t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/10289l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/10289.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/10289t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/10289l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "VI9qpj5z-S0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VI9qpj5z-S0", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/VI9qpj5z-S0?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/VI9qpj5z-S0/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/VI9qpj5z-S0/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/VI9qpj5z-S0/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/VI9qpj5z-S0/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/VI9qpj5z-S0/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Love Hina Again"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30e9\u30d6 \u3072\u306a Again"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Love Hina Again"}], "title": "Love Hina Again", "title_english": "Love Hina Again", "title_japanese": "\u30e9\u30d6 \u3072\u306a Again", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "OVA", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 3, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2002-01-26T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2002-03-27T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 26, "month": 1, "year": 2002}, "to": {"day": 27, "month": 3, "year": 2002}}, "string": "Jan 26, 2002 to Mar 27, 2002"}, "duration": "28 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.2, "scored_by": 52855, "rank": 3446, "popularity": 2493, "members": 87971, "favorites": 87, "synopsis": "Keitaro has finally passed the entrance exams, and is officially a Toudai student.

However, during his classmate Woo Jihyeok's live stream, Hobin completely snaps after a humiliating incident.

As both men refuse to let go of their desires, an unusual relationship forms between a troubled woman, an unrelenting ghost, and a stubborn man in love.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "summer", "year": 2012, "broadcast": {"day": "Fridays", "time": "01:15", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Fridays at 01:15 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 53, "type": "anime", "name": "Dentsu", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/53/Dentsu"}, {"mal_id": 169, "type": "anime", "name": "Fuji TV", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/169/Fuji_TV"}, {"mal_id": 245, "type": "anime", "name": "TOHO", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/245/TOHO"}, {"mal_id": 757, "type": "anime", "name": "Sony Music Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/757/Sony_Music_Entertainment"}, {"mal_id": 1765, "type": "anime", "name": "Shodensha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1765/Shodensha"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 376, "type": "anime", "name": "Sentai Filmworks", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 95, "type": "anime", "name": "Doga Kobo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/95/Doga_Kobo"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}, {"mal_id": 37, "type": "anime", "name": "Supernatural", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 50, "type": "anime", "name": "Adult Cast", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 43, "type": "anime", "name": "Josei", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/43/Josei"}]}, {"mal_id": 2508, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/2508/Genshiken_2", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1958/94708.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1958/94708t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1958/94708l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1958/94708.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1958/94708t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1958/94708l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "iD6ufvvwi-A", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD6ufvvwi-A", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/iD6ufvvwi-A?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/iD6ufvvwi-A/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/iD6ufvvwi-A/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/iD6ufvvwi-A/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/iD6ufvvwi-A/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/iD6ufvvwi-A/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Genshiken 2"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Gendai Shikaku Bunka Kenkyuukai 2"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u3052\u3093\u3057\u3051\u30932"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Genshiken 2"}, {"type": "German", "title": "Genshiken Staffel 2"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "Genshiken Nidaime"}, {"type": "French", "title": "Genshiken Saison 2"}], "title": "Genshiken 2", "title_english": "Genshiken 2", "title_japanese": "\u3052\u3093\u3057\u3051\u30932", "title_synonyms": ["Gendai Shikaku Bunka Kenkyuukai 2"], "type": "TV", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2007-10-10T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2007-12-26T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 10, "month": 10, "year": 2007}, "to": {"day": 26, "month": 12, "year": 2007}}, "string": "Oct 10, 2007 to Dec 26, 2007"}, "duration": "24 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.74, "scored_by": 46559, "rank": 1238, "popularity": 2503, "members": 87316, "favorites": 218, "synopsis": "The Society for the Study of Modern Visual Culture, otherwise known as Genshiken, is now under the charge of a more confident Sasahara.

The program forces them into fabricated realities, where they each experience an ideal romantic version of their bond with Ichika. Once Ichika returns to IS Academy, it is up to him to rescue the five girls and wake them from this virtual reality.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 1443, "type": "anime", "name": "Overlap", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1443/Overlap"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 376, "type": "anime", "name": "Sentai Filmworks", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 441, "type": "anime", "name": "8bit", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/441/8bit"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}, {"mal_id": 9, "type": "anime", "name": "Ecchi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/9/Ecchi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 35, "type": "anime", "name": "Harem", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/35/Harem"}, {"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 33241, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/33241/Honobono_Log", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1307/121781.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1307/121781t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1307/121781l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1307/121781.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1307/121781t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1307/121781l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Honobono Log"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u307b\u306e\u307c\u306e\u30ed\u30b0"}], "title": "Honobono Log", "title_english": null, "title_japanese": "\u307b\u306e\u307c\u306e\u30ed\u30b0", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "TV", "source": "Picture book", "episodes": 10, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2016-06-07T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2016-06-18T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 7, "month": 6, "year": 2016}, "to": {"day": 18, "month": 6, "year": 2016}}, "string": "Jun 7, 2016 to Jun 18, 2016"}, "duration": "2 min per ep", "rating": "G - All Ages", "score": 7.33, "scored_by": 36526, "rank": 2761, "popularity": 2532, "members": 85540, "favorites": 350, "synopsis": "Some of us are fortunate enough to have a partner to confide in on our bad days.

Once Alma plugs him into one of the ship's ports, he discovers the devastating potential of his EX-ARM by effortlessly hacking and assuming control of the vessel.\n\nUpon safely arriving back on land, Akira meets the other members of the EX-ARM Countermeasure Prevention Team, a police division working to mitigate the effects of EX-ARMs. Witnessing the atrocities committed by those who seek the power of EX-ARMs, he resolves to join the team and put an end to the terror caused by these weapons.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "winter", "year": 2021, "broadcast": {"day": "Mondays", "time": "01:05", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Mondays at 01:05 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 323, "type": "anime", "name": "Nippon Columbia", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/323/Nippon_Columbia"}, {"mal_id": 843, "type": "anime", "name": "BS Fuji", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/843/BS_Fuji"}, {"mal_id": 1365, "type": "anime", "name": "Shueisha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1365/Shueisha"}, {"mal_id": 1468, "type": "anime", "name": "Crunchyroll", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1468/Crunchyroll"}, {"mal_id": 1492, "type": "anime", "name": "Yomiuri TV Enterprise", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1492/Yomiuri_TV_Enterprise"}, {"mal_id": 1996, "type": "anime", "name": "MAGNET", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1996/MAGNET"}, {"mal_id": 2109, "type": "anime", "name": "Video Market", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2109/Video_Market"}, {"mal_id": 2187, "type": "anime", "name": "Royal Limousine", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2187/Royal_Limousine"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 3051, "type": "anime", "name": "Anime Limited", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/3051/Anime_Limited"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 2129, "type": "anime", "name": "Visual Flight", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2129/Visual_Flight"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 42, "type": "anime", "name": "Seinen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]}, {"mal_id": 28771, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/28771/Yu\u2606Gi\u2606Oh_The_Dark_Side_of_Dimensions", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/77614.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/77614t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/77614l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/77614.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/77614t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/77614l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "dhLfAM6KCTU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhLfAM6KCTU", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/dhLfAM6KCTU?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/dhLfAM6KCTU/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/dhLfAM6KCTU/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/dhLfAM6KCTU/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/dhLfAM6KCTU/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/dhLfAM6KCTU/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Yu\u2606Gi\u2606Oh!

And then things start to get really weird... Magical powers? Everything turning into chocolate? Is life via the web warping Sasami's brain, or is it the universe that's going crazy?\n\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)", "background": "", "season": "winter", "year": 2013, "broadcast": {"day": "Fridays", "time": "01:25", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Fridays at 01:25 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 17, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"}, {"mal_id": 145, "type": "anime", "name": "TBS", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/145/TBS"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 376, "type": "anime", "name": "Sentai Filmworks", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 44, "type": "anime", "name": "Shaft", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/44/Shaft"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}, {"mal_id": 37, "type": "anime", "name": "Supernatural", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 58445, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/58445/Sayounara_Ryuusei_Konnichiwa_Jinsei", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1225/144606.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1225/144606t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1225/144606l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1225/144606.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1225/144606t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1225/144606l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "dAYaQ_jSpdg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAYaQ_jSpdg", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/dAYaQ_jSpdg?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/dAYaQ_jSpdg/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/dAYaQ_jSpdg/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/dAYaQ_jSpdg/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/dAYaQ_jSpdg/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/dAYaQ_jSpdg/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Sayounara Ryuusei, Konnichiwa Jinsei"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Goodbye Dragon Life"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Hello Human Life"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u3055\u3088\u3046\u306a\u3089\u7adc\u751f\u3001\u3053\u3093\u306b\u3061\u306f\u4eba\u751f"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Good Bye, Dragon Life"}], "title": "Sayounara Ryuusei, Konnichiwa Jinsei", "title_english": "Good Bye, Dragon Life", "title_japanese": "\u3055\u3088\u3046\u306a\u3089\u7adc\u751f\u3001\u3053\u3093\u306b\u3061\u306f\u4eba\u751f", "title_synonyms": ["Goodbye Dragon Life", "Hello Human Life"], "type": "TV", "source": "Light novel", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2024-10-11T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2024-12-27T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 11, "month": 10, "year": 2024}, "to": {"day": 27, "month": 12, "year": 2024}}, "string": "Oct 11, 2024 to Dec 27, 2024"}, "duration": "24 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 6.34, "scored_by": 36327, "rank": 8223, "popularity": 2549, "members": 84807, "favorites": 184, "synopsis": "Long ago, a human managed to defeat the oldest, most powerful dragon of them all.

However, since the first ETM12 two thousand years ago, the original batch of Eto-shin reigns with no one being able to replace them.\n\nNyaa-tan is a cat Eto-musume who aspires to become a member of the zodiac in the ongoing ETM12.

To that end, she must win various types of battles using Sol/Lull\u2014divine energy created by people's positive emotions. This task is not easy however, as her powers as an Eto-musume are far below the abilities of a single Eto-shin. As such, she needs a constant source of energy.\n\nBut in a chance encounter, Nyaa-tan meets Takeru Amato, a man who has just transferred to the apartment where she is secretly staying. To Nyaa-tan's delight, Takeru discovers that he gives out high quality Sol/Lull\u2014something that sets him apart from most people. With this, the story of Takeru and Nyaa-tan begins.

The only characteristic he has to go by is that the murderer has a claw for an arm, hence the murderer being referred to as The Claw Man. During his travels, Van happens to pass through the city of Evergreen, which is defending itself from bandits who aim to rob the city of its treasury. It is in this city that Van meets Wendy Garret, a timid young girl who is looking for her kidnapped brother. When the city pleads for Van's assistance to defend it, he refuses, claiming it has nothing to do with him and thus leaves the city on its own to deal with the peril. Soon after, Van comes across the raiding bandits himself and they eventually tick off the swordsman to a degree where he takes action against them for his own personal vendetta. Surprisingly, Van learns that the bandits had ties with The Claw Man, and in kidnapping Wendy's brother for a reason they did not disclose. After the bandits are dealt with easily, Van and, much to his chagrin, Wendy continue the journey in search of The Claw Man. Little do they know, however, that The Claw Man is involved with something more atrocious than either could fathom.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "summer", "year": 2005, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": "Unknown"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 210, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio Tulip", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/210/Studio_Tulip"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}, {"mal_id": 1459, "type": "anime", "name": "Geneon Entertainment USA", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1459/Geneon_Entertainment_USA"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 88, "type": "anime", "name": "AIC ASTA", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/88/AIC_ASTA"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 18, "type": "anime", "name": "Mecha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 33338, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/33338/One_Piece__Heart_of_Gold", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1673/120160.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1673/120160t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1673/120160l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1673/120160.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1673/120160t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1673/120160l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "One Piece: Heart of Gold"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30ef\u30f3\u30d4\u30fc\u30b9 \uff5e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c8\u30aa\u30d6 \u30b4\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\uff5e"}, {"type": "English", "title": "One Piece: Heart of Gold"}], "title": "One Piece: Heart of Gold", "title_english": "One Piece: Heart of Gold", "title_japanese": "\u30ef\u30f3\u30d4\u30fc\u30b9 \uff5e\u30cf\u30fc\u30c8\u30aa\u30d6 \u30b4\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\uff5e", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "TV Special", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2016-07-16T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 16, "month": 7, "year": 2016}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Jul 16, 2016"}, "duration": "1 hr 44 min", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.48, "scored_by": 44338, "rank": 2088, "popularity": 2598, "members": 82151, "favorites": 47, "synopsis": "A girl named Olga is pursued by both the World Government and a man named Mad Treasure, as she is the only one who knows the location of the Pure Gold, a substance that can buy the entire world.

Having played the role of king in the coalition battle, Zheng has the trust of the people\u2014but L\u00fc is far from out of the fight. In 18 months, he plans to interrupt Zheng's coming-of-age ceremony.\n\nMeanwhile, a Zhao army numbering 20,000 troops has set out toward Qin. In the royal court, due to the lack of generals capable of responding to the incoming threat, L\u00fc slyly suggests that Zheng take command. However, Cheng Jiao, Zheng's half-brother, volunteers instead. As they grew to trust each other during the coalition battle, Zheng now accepts Jiao as his replacement.\n\nHowever, the Zhao forces retreat a mere half-day after clashing with Jiao's army. With trouble quickly brewing in the shadows, the internal struggle of Qin is only complicated further. There are only two men Zheng feels he can rely on: Bi, a general who commands 30,000 men; and Xin, the leader of the Fei Xin force.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Kingdom 4th Season adapts chapters 364-441 of the original manga.

As she tries to convince Chiyori out of her cruel fate, Ruuko learns more about a WIXOSS novel\u2014which may reveal the secrets of LRIGs and the Selector battles' very existence.\n\nMeanwhile, Akira Aoi and her model career have rebounded thanks to Iona, who is now possessed by Ulith. With her life back on track, Akira pledges to assist Ulith in any way she can. Unbeknownst to her, Ulith is scheming to utilize a familiar LRIG to not only torment Ruuko but also prevent the latter's wish from ever being fulfilled.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Selector Spread WIXOSS was released on Blu-ray and DVD in Japan from February 25, 2015 to June 24, 2015, and in North America by Funimation Entertainment on June 28, 2016.", "season": "fall", "year": 2014, "broadcast": {"day": "Saturdays", "time": "01:05", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Saturdays at 01:05 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 306, "type": "anime", "name": "Magic Capsule", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/306/Magic_Capsule"}, {"mal_id": 415, "type": "anime", "name": "Warner Bros.

As they get deeper into the mysteries of the dragons, they encounter new friends and enemies, and also begin to develop a closer relationship. \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)", "background": "", "season": "fall", "year": 2007, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": "Unknown"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 139, "type": "anime", "name": "Nihon Ad Systems", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/139/Nihon_Ad_Systems"}, {"mal_id": 1597, "type": "anime", "name": "Sotsu Music Publishing", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1597/Sotsu_Music_Publishing"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 3, "type": "anime", "name": "Gonzo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/3/Gonzo"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 18, "type": "anime", "name": "Mecha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 38422, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/38422/High_Score_Girl__Extra_Stage", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1057/111384.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1057/111384t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1057/111384l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1057/111384.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1057/111384t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1057/111384l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "_N-BnjZnJWk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N-BnjZnJWk", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/_N-BnjZnJWk?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/_N-BnjZnJWk/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/_N-BnjZnJWk/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/_N-BnjZnJWk/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/_N-BnjZnJWk/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/_N-BnjZnJWk/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "High Score Girl: Extra Stage"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "High Score Girl OVA"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30cf\u30a4\u30b9\u30b3\u30a2\u30ac\u30fc\u30eb EXTRA STAGE"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Hi Score Girl: Extra Stage"}, {"type": "German", "title": "High Score Girl Folge 13-15"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "High Score Girl 13\u00aa, 14\u00aa y 15\u00aa Ronda"}, {"type": "French", "title": "High Score Girl \u00c9pisode 13-15"}], "title": "High Score Girl: Extra Stage", "title_english": "Hi Score Girl: Extra Stage", "title_japanese": "\u30cf\u30a4\u30b9\u30b3\u30a2\u30ac\u30fc\u30eb EXTRA STAGE", "title_synonyms": ["High Score Girl OVA"], "type": "OVA", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 3, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2019-03-20T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 20, "month": 3, "year": 2019}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Mar 20, 2019"}, "duration": "25 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.95, "scored_by": 49561, "rank": 765, "popularity": 2645, "members": 79873, "favorites": 172, "synopsis": "Four years after they first met, Haruo Yaguchi , Akira Oono, and Koharu Hidaka remain the best of friends.

To do so, the Four Divine Kings must break four seals located in four different kingdoms.\n\nTargeted for its seal, the kingdom of Metallicana struggles to repel the army commanded by the Four Divine Kings. With hope dwindling, all eyes turn to the daughter of Metallicana's Grand Priest, Yoko Tia Noto. Not only is she aware that her adopted younger brother, Lucien Renlen, is Dark Schneider's prison of flesh, but she also knows the ritual to break the seal. Left with no other choice, Yoko successfully releases Dark Schneider, whose twisted personality has not changed over the years. As the fate of the world depends on where his allegiance lies, Yoko seems to be the only person who has some control over the powerful magician. But convincing Dark Schneider to turn against his old allies and protect those Yoko holds dear may prove to be an impossible feat.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 415, "type": "anime", "name": "Warner Bros.

At the top of the Kanto branch of the LDF stands the Library Task Force (LTF): an elite squad consisting of only the most exceptional fighters.\n\nAs a high schooler, Iku Kasahara experienced the terror of censorship first-hand when she refused to surrender the newest volume of her favorite series to MBC agents.

Given her struggles, Kasahara is shocked when she is selected as one of the two new LTF recruits as a result of Doujou's recommendation. As Kasahara does all she can to become worthy of the LTF and unravel her enigmatic superior's motivations, she wages war\u2014both on the battlefield and in her personal life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 2008, "broadcast": {"day": "Fridays", "time": "00:45", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Fridays at 00:45 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 53, "type": "anime", "name": "Dentsu", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/53/Dentsu"}, {"mal_id": 169, "type": "anime", "name": "Fuji TV", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/169/Fuji_TV"}, {"mal_id": 325, "type": "anime", "name": "Code", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/325/Code"}, {"mal_id": 517, "type": "anime", "name": "Asmik Ace", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/517/Asmik_Ace"}, {"mal_id": 681, "type": "anime", "name": "ASCII Media Works", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/681/ASCII_Media_Works"}, {"mal_id": 757, "type": "anime", "name": "Sony Music Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/757/Sony_Music_Entertainment"}, {"mal_id": 1175, "type": "anime", "name": "Atelier Musa", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1175/Atelier_Musa"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 467, "type": "anime", "name": "Discotek Media", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/467/Discotek_Media"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Production I.G", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 50, "type": "anime", "name": "Adult Cast", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"}, {"mal_id": 38, "type": "anime", "name": "Military", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 19511, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/19511/Naruto__Shippuuden_-_Sunny_Side_Battle", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1047/91638.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1047/91638t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1047/91638l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1047/91638.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1047/91638t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1047/91638l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Naruto: Shippuuden - Sunny Side Battle"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Naruto: Shippuuden - Jump Festa 2013 Special"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Naruto: Shippuuden - Jump Super Anime Tour 2013 Special"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30ca\u30eb\u30c8-NARUTO-\u75be\u98a8\u4f1d \u30b5\u30cb\u30fc\u30fb\u30b5\u30a4\u30c9\u30fb\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Naruto Shippuden: Sunny Side Battle"}], "title": "Naruto: Shippuuden - Sunny Side Battle", "title_english": "Naruto Shippuden: Sunny Side Battle", "title_japanese": "\u30ca\u30eb\u30c8-NARUTO-\u75be\u98a8\u4f1d \u30b5\u30cb\u30fc\u30fb\u30b5\u30a4\u30c9\u30fb\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb", "title_synonyms": ["Naruto: Shippuuden - Jump Festa 2013 Special", "Naruto: Shippuuden - Jump Super Anime Tour 2013 Special"], "type": "Special", "source": "Original", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2013-10-06T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 6, "month": 10, "year": 2013}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Oct 6, 2013"}, "duration": "11 min", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.58, "scored_by": 42067, "rank": 1714, "popularity": 2685, "members": 77924, "favorites": 184, "synopsis": "Back at their childhood home, siblings Itachi and Sasuke Uchiha experience an unusual morning together when Itachi becomes obsessed with cooking the perfect fried egg for Sasuke.

One day, she's picked up by an ambitious casino manager named Shell who gives her everything she could want. Renewed by a false innocence, a false past, and now the false life Shell has given her, Balot feels grateful. However, she can't help but be curious about why he's done so much for her, so she does some research about his past on a computer. This turns out to be a mistake which will change her life greatly. When Shell finds out what she's done, he attempts to burn her to death by blowing up her car.\n\nDue to the high crime rate in Mardock, a new law called \"Scramble 09\" has given police carte blanche to take extreme and otherwise illegal measures to revive crime witnesses. With this in mind, they allow a professor to bring Balot back from the brink of death by reassembling her entire body with reinforced synthetic fiber. When she finally wakes up, her confused mental state eventually turns toward revenge as Shell is revealed as her killer.\n\n(Source: Nippon Cinema)", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 17, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"}, {"mal_id": 92, "type": "anime", "name": "Starchild Records", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/92/Starchild_Records"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 376, "type": "anime", "name": "Sentai Filmworks", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 309, "type": "anime", "name": "GoHands", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/309/GoHands"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}, {"mal_id": 41, "type": "anime", "name": "Suspense", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/41/Suspense"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 40, "type": "anime", "name": "Psychological", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 53621, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/53621/Jijou_wo_Shiranai_Tenkousei_ga_Guigui_Kuru", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1350/133642.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1350/133642t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1350/133642l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1350/133642.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1350/133642t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1350/133642l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "2zepo52nU_w", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zepo52nU_w", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/2zepo52nU_w?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/2zepo52nU_w/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/2zepo52nU_w/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/2zepo52nU_w/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/2zepo52nU_w/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/2zepo52nU_w/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Jijou wo Shiranai Tenkousei ga Guigui Kuru."}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "The Clueless Transfer Student Is Assertive."}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u4e8b\u60c5\u3092\u77e5\u3089\u306a\u3044\u8ee2\u6821\u751f\u304c\u30b0\u30a4\u30b0\u30a4\u304f\u308b\u3002"}, {"type": "English", "title": "My Clueless First Friend"}], "title": "Jijou wo Shiranai Tenkousei ga Guigui Kuru.", "title_english": "My Clueless First Friend", "title_japanese": "\u4e8b\u60c5\u3092\u77e5\u3089\u306a\u3044\u8ee2\u6821\u751f\u304c\u30b0\u30a4\u30b0\u30a4\u304f\u308b\u3002", "title_synonyms": ["The Clueless Transfer Student Is Assertive."], "type": "TV", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 13, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2023-04-09T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2023-07-02T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 9, "month": 4, "year": 2023}, "to": {"day": 2, "month": 7, "year": 2023}}, "string": "Apr 9, 2023 to Jul 2, 2023"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.51, "scored_by": 33763, "rank": 1970, "popularity": 2720, "members": 76239, "favorites": 313, "synopsis": "Akane Nishimura's quiet nature makes her classmates perceive her as a gloomy and unlikeable person.

Accompanied by Doumeki, he finds that this task is more akin to a treasure hunt, with each item leading them to another, and another, guiding them to an unexpected yet inevitable ending.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Bundled with the limited editions of the 14th and 15th volumes of the xxxHOLiC manga.", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 159, "type": "anime", "name": "Kodansha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"}, {"mal_id": 3024, "type": "anime", "name": "Fonishia", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/3024/Fonishia"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Production I.G", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 7, "type": "anime", "name": "Mystery", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"}, {"mal_id": 37, "type": "anime", "name": "Supernatural", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 42, "type": "anime", "name": "Seinen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]}, {"mal_id": 36943, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/36943/Tachibanakan_Triangle", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1594/108629.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1594/108629t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1594/108629l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1594/108629.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1594/108629t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1594/108629l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "z5NdoHTxPm8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5NdoHTxPm8", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/z5NdoHTxPm8?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/z5NdoHTxPm8/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/z5NdoHTxPm8/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/z5NdoHTxPm8/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/z5NdoHTxPm8/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/z5NdoHTxPm8/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Tachibanakan Triangle"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Tachibanakan To Lie Angle"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u7acb\u82b1\u9928To Lie\u3042\u3093\u3050\u308b"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Love To-LIE-Angle"}, {"type": "German", "title": "Love To-LIE-Angle"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "Love To-LIE-Angle"}, {"type": "French", "title": "Love To-LIE-Angle"}], "title": "Tachibanakan Triangle", "title_english": "Love To-LIE-Angle", "title_japanese": "\u7acb\u82b1\u9928To Lie\u3042\u3093\u3050\u308b", "title_synonyms": ["Tachibanakan To Lie Angle"], "type": "TV", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2018-04-04T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2018-06-20T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 4, "month": 4, "year": 2018}, "to": {"day": 20, "month": 6, "year": 2018}}, "string": "Apr 4, 2018 to Jun 20, 2018"}, "duration": "3 min per ep", "rating": "R+ - Mild Nudity", "score": 5.62, "scored_by": 28781, "rank": 12060, "popularity": 2761, "members": 74495, "favorites": 93, "synopsis": "As Hanabi Natsuno returns home after six years in Tokyo, memories flood into her.
