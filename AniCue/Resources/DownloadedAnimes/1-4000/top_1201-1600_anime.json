However, Kino is not as helpless as her cute appearance and courteous demeanor suggest. Armed with \"Cannon\" and \"Woodsman,\" her trusted handguns, Kino isn't afraid to kill anyone who would dare to get in her way. Always by her side is her best friend and loyal companion Hermes, a sentient motorcycle, who supports Kino through the sorrows and hardships of their journey. Together, they travel the vast countryside with the shared goal of always moving forward, and a single rule: never stay in one country for more than three days.\n\nAs Kino and Hermes encounter new people and learn the rules of their civilizations, they grow and find out more about their own values and virtues. But as Kino slowly discovers the world around her, she also finds herself facing dangers that linger within the vast unknown.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "At a stage event at the Dengeki Bunko Festival 2017, it was announced that this new adaptation will prioritize the fan favorite stories.

Asu no Yoichi! follows Yoichi as he stumbles through his new life and tries to learn how to live in the modern world with his new family.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "winter", "year": 2009, "broadcast": {"day": "Fridays", "time": "01:29", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Fridays at 01:29 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 104, "type": "anime", "name": "Lantis", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/104/Lantis"}, {"mal_id": 145, "type": "anime", "name": "TBS", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/145/TBS"}, {"mal_id": 166, "type": "anime", "name": "Movic", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 376, "type": "anime", "name": "Sentai Filmworks", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 48, "type": "anime", "name": "AIC", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/48/AIC"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}, {"mal_id": 9, "type": "anime", "name": "Ecchi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/9/Ecchi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 35, "type": "anime", "name": "Harem", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/35/Harem"}, {"mal_id": 17, "type": "anime", "name": "Martial Arts", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/17/Martial_Arts"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]}, {"mal_id": 37993, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/37993/Watashi_ni_Tenshi_ga_Maiorita", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1778/100470.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1778/100470t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1778/100470l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1778/100470.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1778/100470t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1778/100470l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "xDXorSZaCHU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDXorSZaCHU", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/xDXorSZaCHU?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/xDXorSZaCHU/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/xDXorSZaCHU/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/xDXorSZaCHU/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/xDXorSZaCHU/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/xDXorSZaCHU/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Watashi ni Tenshi ga Maiorita!"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Wataten"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u79c1\u306b\u5929\u4f7f\u304c\u821e\u3044\u964d\u308a\u305f\uff01"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Wataten! an Angel Flew Down to Me"}, {"type": "German", "title": "Wataten!: An Angel Flew Down to Me"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "Wataten!: An Angel Flew Down to Me"}, {"type": "French", "title": "Wataten!: An Angel Flew Down to Me"}], "title": "Watashi ni Tenshi ga Maiorita!", "title_english": "Wataten! an Angel Flew Down to Me", "title_japanese": "\u79c1\u306b\u5929\u4f7f\u304c\u821e\u3044\u964d\u308a\u305f\uff01", "title_synonyms": ["Wataten"], "type": "TV", "source": "4-koma manga", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2019-01-08T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2019-03-26T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 8, "month": 1, "year": 2019}, "to": {"day": 26, "month": 3, "year": 2019}}, "string": "Jan 8, 2019 to Mar 26, 2019"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.25, "scored_by": 87706, "rank": 3172, "popularity": 1250, "members": 214007, "favorites": 966, "synopsis": "College student Miyako Hoshino is quite shy around other people.

After getting to know each other, the two decide to create a cooking club, and after a few bad-blooded misunderstandings, Ranka soon joins the club as well.\n\nThus begins the howl-some and howl-arious story of two normal humans; an adorable wolf; a cheerful koala; a sluggish, blonde sloth; and a feline with cattitude in their newfound club\u2014in a story that teaches that friendship can be forged by creatures of different kinds.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "winter", "year": 2020, "broadcast": {"day": "Tuesdays", "time": "00:30", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Tuesdays at 00:30 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 140, "type": "anime", "name": "Animax", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/140/Animax"}, {"mal_id": 1211, "type": "anime", "name": "Tokyo MX", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1211/Tokyo_MX"}, {"mal_id": 1587, "type": "anime", "name": "Cygames", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1587/Cygames"}, {"mal_id": 1908, "type": "anime", "name": "Legs", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1908/Legs"}, {"mal_id": 1933, "type": "anime", "name": "Happinet", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1933/Happinet"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 418, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio Gokumi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/418/Studio_Gokumi"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 9, "type": "anime", "name": "Ecchi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/9/Ecchi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 51, "type": "anime", "name": "Anthropomorphic", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/51/Anthropomorphic"}, {"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 357, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/357/Bokusatsu_Tenshi_Dokuro-chan", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/13210.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/13210t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/13210l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/13210.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/13210t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/13210l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-chan"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Club-To-Death Angel Dokuro-chan"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u64b2\u6bba\u5929\u4f7f\u30c9\u30af\u30ed\u3061\u3083\u3093"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-chan"}, {"type": "German", "title": "Bludgeoning Angel Dokoro-chan"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "Bludgeoning Angel Dokoro-chan"}, {"type": "French", "title": "Dokuro-Chan"}], "title": "Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-chan", "title_english": "Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-chan", "title_japanese": "\u64b2\u6bba\u5929\u4f7f\u30c9\u30af\u30ed\u3061\u3083\u3093", "title_synonyms": ["Club-To-Death Angel Dokuro-chan"], "type": "OVA", "source": "Light novel", "episodes": 4, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2005-03-13T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2005-09-22T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 13, "month": 3, "year": 2005}, "to": {"day": 22, "month": 9, "year": 2005}}, "string": "Mar 13, 2005 to Sep 22, 2005"}, "duration": "26 min per ep", "rating": "R - 17+ (violence & profanity)", "score": 6.53, "scored_by": 115220, "rank": 7024, "popularity": 1254, "members": 213206, "favorites": 951, "synopsis": "Sakura Kusakabe, a mere junior high student, has committed a horrible crime.

However, Saitou's presence may just be the catalyst that will connect a diverse cast of people from different places, slowly uncovering the fate that could bring a great change to this world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Benriya Saitou-san, Isekai ni Iku was released on Blu-ray and DVD in three volumes from March 24, 2023, to May 24, 2023.", "season": "winter", "year": 2023, "broadcast": {"day": "Sundays", "time": "22:30", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Sundays at 22:30 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 238, "type": "anime", "name": "AT-X", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"}, {"mal_id": 1680, "type": "anime", "name": "BS NTV", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1680/BS_NTV"}, {"mal_id": 1696, "type": "anime", "name": "Kadokawa", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"}, {"mal_id": 2289, "type": "anime", "name": "GREE Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2289/GREE_Entertainment"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 1468, "type": "anime", "name": "Crunchyroll", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1468/Crunchyroll"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 605, "type": "anime", "name": "C2C", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/605/C2C"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 62, "type": "anime", "name": "Isekai", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/62/Isekai"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 56352, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/56352/Loop_7-kaime_no_Akuyaku_Reijou_wa_Moto_Tekikoku_de_Jiyuu_Kimama_na_Hanayome_Seikatsu_wo_Mankitsu_suru", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1533/140617.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1533/140617t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1533/140617l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1533/140617.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1533/140617t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1533/140617l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "Cw0J_9_bwYc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw0J_9_bwYc", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cw0J_9_bwYc?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/Cw0J_9_bwYc/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/Cw0J_9_bwYc/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/Cw0J_9_bwYc/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/Cw0J_9_bwYc/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/Cw0J_9_bwYc/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Loop 7-kaime no Akuyaku Reijou wa, Moto Tekikoku de Jiyuu Kimama na Hanayome Seikatsu wo Mankitsu suru"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "The Villainess Wants to Enjoy a Carefree Married Life in a Former Enemy Country in Her Seventh Loop!"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "The Villainess of 7th Time Loop Enjoys Free-Spirited Bride Life in the Former Hostile Country"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30eb\u30fc\u30d77\u56de\u76ee\u306e\u60aa\u5f79\u4ee4\u5b22\u306f\u3001\u5143\u6575\u56fd\u3067\u81ea\u7531\u6c17\u307e\u307e\u306a\u82b1\u5ac1\u751f\u6d3b\u3092\u6e80\u55ab\u3059\u308b"}, {"type": "English", "title": "7th Time Loop: The Villainess Enjoys a Carefree Life Married to Her Worst Enemy!"}], "title": "Loop 7-kaime no Akuyaku Reijou wa, Moto Tekikoku de Jiyuu Kimama na Hanayome Seikatsu wo Mankitsu suru", "title_english": "7th Time Loop: The Villainess Enjoys a Carefree Life Married to Her Worst Enemy!", "title_japanese": "\u30eb\u30fc\u30d77\u56de\u76ee\u306e\u60aa\u5f79\u4ee4\u5b22\u306f\u3001\u5143\u6575\u56fd\u3067\u81ea\u7531\u6c17\u307e\u307e\u306a\u82b1\u5ac1\u751f\u6d3b\u3092\u6e80\u55ab\u3059\u308b", "title_synonyms": ["The Villainess Wants to Enjoy a Carefree Married Life in a Former Enemy Country in Her Seventh Loop!", "The Villainess of 7th Time Loop Enjoys Free-Spirited Bride Life in the Former Hostile Country"], "type": "TV", "source": "Light novel", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2024-01-07T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2024-03-24T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 7, "month": 1, "year": 2024}, "to": {"day": 24, "month": 3, "year": 2024}}, "string": "Jan 7, 2024 to Mar 24, 2024"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 -

Ken, who historically has had below average grades, worked hard to improve them to be accepted into the student council, with the ultimate goal of surrounding himself with girls who fawn over him.\n\nUnfortunately for the vice president, things do not go quite as planned. Not only do the ladies of the council continually rebuff his advances, they also prefer to focus on more important and \"boring\" activities, such as organizing school events and managing the other clubs. But a few minor hurdles like these won't stop Ken from chasing after his dreams, even if they seem a bit ridiculous.  \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "fall", "year": 2009, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": "Unknown"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 113, "type": "anime", "name": "Kadokawa Shoten", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/113/Kadokawa_Shoten"}, {"mal_id": 779, "type": "anime", "name": "AMG MUSIC", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/779/AMG_MUSIC"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 376, "type": "anime", "name": "Sentai Filmworks", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 37, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio Deen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/37/Studio_Deen"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 35, "type": "anime", "name": "Harem", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/35/Harem"}, {"mal_id": 20, "type": "anime", "name": "Parody", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/20/Parody"}, {"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 19703, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/19703/Kyousou_Giga_TV", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/85431.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/85431t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/85431l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/85431.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/85431t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/85431l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "Tafsb_RMR_U", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tafsb_RMR_U", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tafsb_RMR_U?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/Tafsb_RMR_U/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/Tafsb_RMR_U/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/Tafsb_RMR_U/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/Tafsb_RMR_U/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/Tafsb_RMR_U/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Kyousou Giga (TV)"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Kyousogiga (TV)"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u4eac\u9a12\u622f\u753b"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Kyousougiga"}, {"type": "German", "title": "Kyousougiga"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "Kyousougiga"}, {"type": "French", "title": "Kyousougiga"}], "title": "Kyousou Giga (TV)", "title_english": "Kyousougiga", "title_japanese": "\u4eac\u9a12\u622f\u753b", "title_synonyms": ["Kyousogiga (TV)"], "type": "TV", "source": "Original", "episodes": 10, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2013-10-10T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2013-12-19T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 10, "month": 10, "year": 2013}, "to": {"day": 19, "month": 12, "year": 2013}}, "string": "Oct 10, 2013 to Dec 19, 2013"}, "duration": "25 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.69, "scored_by": 55271, "rank": 1358, "popularity": 1305, "members": 203302, "favorites": 2042, "synopsis": "Long ago, there was a monk named Myoue who could bring anything he drew to life.

However, Natsume firmly rejects the clan's invitation since not all exorcists are as reasonable as his friend Shuuichi Natori, and many improperly and indiscriminately seal away every youkai in their way. Unsatisfied with Natsume's answer, Seiji Matoba blackmails Natsume into attending a grand gathering of powerful exorcist families.

Through marriage, both heirs aim to bring peace to the clans. But their hopes are dashed when flames of rivalry between their clans are reignited, and they are dragged into another war.\n\nIeyasu's two grandsons have both claimed to be the next heir to the shogunate. To resolve this dispute, both the Kouga and Iga are ordered to send their 10 best warriors to fight in a bloody battle royale, with each clan representing one of the potential shogunate heirs. Two scrolls with the names of the fighters are given and are to be marked in blood upon the given fighter's death. The prize for winning is the favor of the Tokugawa shogunate for a thousand years. Torn between their love for each other and duty to their clans, Gennosuke and Oboro must ultimately decide the fate of their clans.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 2005, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": "Unknown"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 42, "type": "anime", "name": "GDH", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/42/GDH"}, {"mal_id": 159, "type": "anime", "name": "Kodansha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"}, {"mal_id": 1597, "type": "anime", "name": "Sotsu Music Publishing", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1597/Sotsu_Music_Publishing"}, {"mal_id": 2963, "type": "anime", "name": "Future Vision Music", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2963/Future_Vision_Music"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 3, "type": "anime", "name": "Gonzo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/3/Gonzo"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 50, "type": "anime", "name": "Adult Cast", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"}, {"mal_id": 58, "type": "anime", "name": "Gore", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/58/Gore"}, {"mal_id": 13, "type": "anime", "name": "Historical", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}, {"mal_id": 17, "type": "anime", "name": "Martial Arts", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/17/Martial_Arts"}, {"mal_id": 21, "type": "anime", "name": "Samurai", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/21/Samurai"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 42, "type": "anime", "name": "Seinen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]}, {"mal_id": 1690, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/1690/Bokura_no", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1690/97048.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1690/97048t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1690/97048l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1690/97048.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1690/97048t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1690/97048l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "laFq2ANWlXc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laFq2ANWlXc", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/laFq2ANWlXc?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/laFq2ANWlXc/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/laFq2ANWlXc/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/laFq2ANWlXc/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/laFq2ANWlXc/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/laFq2ANWlXc/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Bokura no"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Bokurano: Ours"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u307c\u304f\u3089\u306e"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Bokurano"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "Bokurano"}], "title": "Bokura no", "title_english": "Bokurano", "title_japanese": "\u307c\u304f\u3089\u306e", "title_synonyms": ["Bokurano: Ours"], "type": "TV", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 24, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2007-04-09T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2007-09-25T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 9, "month": 4, "year": 2007}, "to": {"day": 25, "month": 9, "year": 2007}}, "string": "Apr 9, 2007 to Sep 25, 2007"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "R - 17+ (violence & profanity)", "score": 7.59, "scored_by": 55362, "rank": 1671, "popularity": 1334, "members": 198812, "favorites": 1205, "synopsis": "As fifteen children at a summer camp enjoy their carefree vacation together, they stumble upon a small cave near the beach.

She imagines this task will be easy enough, but controlling the disasters created by the oblivious fairies in their pursuit of candy will require a lot more effort than she initially believes.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Jinrui wa Suitai Shimashita adapts content from the first 6 novels of Romeo Tanaka's light novel series of the same title.", "season": "summer", "year": 2012, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": "Unknown"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 48, "type": "anime", "name": "AIC", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/48/AIC"}, {"mal_id": 64, "type": "anime", "name": "Sotsu", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/64/Sotsu"}, {"mal_id": 104, "type": "anime", "name": "Lantis", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/104/Lantis"}, {"mal_id": 144, "type": "anime", "name": "Pony Canyon", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/144/Pony_Canyon"}, {"mal_id": 166, "type": "anime", "name": "Movic", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"}, {"mal_id": 751, "type": "anime", "name": "Marvelous AQL", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/751/Marvelous_AQL"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 376, "type": "anime", "name": "Sentai Filmworks", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 88, "type": "anime", "name": "AIC ASTA", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/88/AIC_ASTA"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 48997, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/48997/Fantasy_Bishoujo_Juniku_Ojisan_to", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1430/120065.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1430/120065t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1430/120065l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1430/120065.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1430/120065t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1430/120065l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "C1J0NsSBhOU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1J0NsSBhOU", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1J0NsSBhOU?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/C1J0NsSBhOU/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/C1J0NsSBhOU/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/C1J0NsSBhOU/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/C1J0NsSBhOU/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/C1J0NsSBhOU/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Fantasy Bishoujo Juniku Ojisan to"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Fabiniku"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Isekai Bishoujo Juniku Ojisan"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u7570\u4e16\u754c\u7f8e\u5c11\u5973\u53d7\u8089\u304a\u3058\u3055\u3093\u3068"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Life with an Ordinary Guy who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout"}], "title": "Fantasy Bishoujo Juniku Ojisan to", "title_english": "Life with an Ordinary Guy who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout", "title_japanese": "\u7570\u4e16\u754c\u7f8e\u5c11\u5973\u53d7\u8089\u304a\u3058\u3055\u3093\u3068", "title_synonyms": ["Fabiniku", "Isekai Bishoujo Juniku Ojisan"], "type": "TV", "source": "Web manga", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2022-01-12T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2022-03-30T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 12, "month": 1, "year": 2022}, "to": {"day": 30, "month": 3, "year": 2022}}, "string": "Jan 12, 2022 to Mar 30, 2022"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.12, "scored_by": 90055, "rank": 3916, "popularity": 1335, "members": 198444, "favorites": 850, "synopsis": "Since their days as students, Tsukasa Jinguuji has had incredible luck with women due to his good looks; Hinata Tachibana has had almost none, overshadowed by Jinguuji's brilliance.

Not only does the threat of other powerhouse schools and musicians remain, but the high school issues of budding romance and soon-to-be-graduating seniors also begin to push the limits of the determined group of teenagers and the future of the koto club.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "fall", "year": 2019, "broadcast": {"day": "Sundays", "time": "01:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Sundays at 01:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 33, "type": "anime", "name": "WOWOW", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/33/WOWOW"}, {"mal_id": 166, "type": "anime", "name": "Movic", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"}, {"mal_id": 460, "type": "anime", "name": "KlockWorx", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/460/KlockWorx"}, {"mal_id": 647, "type": "anime", "name": "Memory-Tech", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/647/Memory-Tech"}, {"mal_id": 1344, "type": "anime", "name": "King Records", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1344/King_Records"}, {"mal_id": 1365, "type": "anime", "name": "Shueisha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1365/Shueisha"}, {"mal_id": 1557, "type": "anime", "name": "Pony Canyon Enterprises", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1557/Pony_Canyon_Enterprises"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 1471, "type": "anime", "name": "Platinum Vision", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1471/Platinum_Vision"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 19, "type": "anime", "name": "Music", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/19/Music"}, {"mal_id": 70, "type": "anime", "name": "Performing Arts", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/70/Performing_Arts"}, {"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]}, {"mal_id": 52969, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/52969/Jitsu_wa_Ore_Saikyou_deshita", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1963/138464.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1963/138464t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1963/138464l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1963/138464.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1963/138464t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1963/138464l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "cKi66qGWH-g", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKi66qGWH-g", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/cKi66qGWH-g?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/cKi66qGWH-g/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/cKi66qGWH-g/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/cKi66qGWH-g/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/cKi66qGWH-g/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/cKi66qGWH-g/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Jitsu wa Ore, Saikyou deshita?"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u5b9f\u306f\u4ffa\u3001\u6700\u5f37\u3067\u3057\u305f?"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Am I Actually the Strongest?"}], "title": "Jitsu wa Ore, Saikyou deshita?", "title_english": "Am I Actually the Strongest?", "title_japanese": "\u5b9f\u306f\u4ffa\u3001\u6700\u5f37\u3067\u3057\u305f?", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "TV", "source": "Light novel", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2023-07-02T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2023-10-01T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 2, "month": 7, "year": 2023}, "to": {"day": 1, "month": 10, "year": 2023}}, "string": "Jul 2, 2023 to Oct 1, 2023"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 6.48, "scored_by": 93046, "rank": 7360, "popularity": 1357, "members": 195138, "favorites": 569, "synopsis": "A 20-year-old shut-in is suddenly transported from his apartment, only to appear in front of a goddess who offers him a second chance at life.

However, their past experiences with the stone cause them reservation, and the brothers are unwilling to help.\n\nBut as they discover the secrets behind Creta's intentions and questionable history, the brothers are drawn into the battle between the rebellious Milos, who desire their liberty, and the Cretan military, who seek absolute power.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 17, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"}, {"mal_id": 53, "type": "anime", "name": "Dentsu", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/53/Dentsu"}, {"mal_id": 58, "type": "anime", "name": "Square Enix", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/58/Square_Enix"}, {"mal_id": 109, "type": "anime", "name": "Shochiku", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/109/Shochiku"}, {"mal_id": 143, "type": "anime", "name": "Mainichi Broadcasting System", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"}, {"mal_id": 145, "type": "anime", "name": "TBS", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/145/TBS"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Bones", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/4/Bones"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 38, "type": "anime", "name": "Military", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]}, {"mal_id": 57066, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/57066/Dungeon_ni_Deai_wo_Motomeru_no_wa_Machigatteiru_Darou_ka_V__Houjou_no_Megami-hen", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1299/144738.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1299/144738t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1299/144738l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1299/144738.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1299/144738t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1299/144738l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "8UJbzK14gto", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UJbzK14gto", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/8UJbzK14gto?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/8UJbzK14gto/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/8UJbzK14gto/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/8UJbzK14gto/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/8UJbzK14gto/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/8UJbzK14gto/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka V: Houjou no Megami-hen"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "DanMachi 5th Season"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Is It Wrong That I Want to Meet You in a Dungeon 5th Season"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30c0\u30f3\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u306b\u51fa\u4f1a\u3044\u3092\u6c42\u3081\u308b\u306e\u306f\u9593\u9055\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3060\u308d\u3046\u304bV \u8c4a\u7a63\u306e\u5973\u795e\u7bc7"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?

Even if their close friend, Masago Matsuo, finds their dynamic a little odd, Katagiri loves her sweet tyrant just the way he is.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 2018, "broadcast": {"day": "Fridays", "time": "22:30", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Fridays at 22:30 (JST)"}, "producers": [], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 96, "type": "anime", "name": "Yumeta Company", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/96/Yumeta_Company"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 43, "type": "anime", "name": "Josei", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/43/Josei"}]}, {"mal_id": 48418, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/48418/Maou_Gakuin_no_Futekigousha_II__Shijou_Saikyou_no_Maou_no_Shiso_Tensei_shite_Shison-tachi_no_Gakkou_e_Kayou_Part_2", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1399/141651.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1399/141651t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1399/141651l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1399/141651.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1399/141651t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1399/141651l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "NvD4Qg2DgJc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvD4Qg2DgJc", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/NvD4Qg2DgJc?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/NvD4Qg2DgJc/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/NvD4Qg2DgJc/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/NvD4Qg2DgJc/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/NvD4Qg2DgJc/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/NvD4Qg2DgJc/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Maou Gakuin no Futekigousha II: Shijou Saikyou no Maou no Shiso, Tensei shite Shison-tachi no Gakkou e Kayou Part 2"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Maou Gakuin no Futekigousha 2nd Season"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "The Misfit of Demon King Academy 2nd Season"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u9b54\u738b\u5b66\u9662\u306e\u4e0d\u9069\u5408\u8005 II \uff5e\u53f2\u4e0a\u6700\u5f37\u306e\u9b54\u738b\u306e\u59cb\u7956\u3001\u8ee2\u751f\u3057\u3066\u5b50\u5b6b\u305f\u3061\u306e\u5b66\u6821\u3078\u901a\u3046\uff5e \u7b2c2\u30af\u30fc\u30eb"}, {"type": "English", "title": "The Misfit of Demon King Academy II Part 2"}], "title": "Maou Gakuin no Futekigousha II: Shijou Saikyou no Maou no Shiso, Tensei shite Shison-tachi no Gakkou e Kayou Part 2", "title_english": "The Misfit of Demon King Academy II Part 2", "title_japanese": "\u9b54\u738b\u5b66\u9662\u306e\u4e0d\u9069\u5408\u8005 II \uff5e\u53f2\u4e0a\u6700\u5f37\u306e\u9b54\u738b\u306e\u59cb\u7956\u3001\u8ee2\u751f\u3057\u3066\u5b50\u5b6b\u305f\u3061\u306e\u5b66\u6821\u3078\u901a\u3046\uff5e \u7b2c2\u30af\u30fc\u30eb", "title_synonyms": ["Maou Gakuin no Futekigousha 2nd Season", "The Misfit of Demon King Academy 2nd Season"], "type": "TV", "source": "Light novel", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2024-04-12T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2024-07-25T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 12, "month": 4, "year": 2024}, "to": {"day": 25, "month": 7, "year": 2024}}, "string": "Apr 12, 2024 to Jul 25, 2024"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "R -

These girls\u2014and their mysterious friend in a wrestling mask\u2014give their observations to the audience, either backstage at the rakugo theater or in various famous locations around Tokyo.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "summer", "year": 2012, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": "Unknown"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 92, "type": "anime", "name": "Starchild Records", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/92/Starchild_Records"}, {"mal_id": 143, "type": "anime", "name": "Mainichi Broadcasting System", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"}, {"mal_id": 159, "type": "anime", "name": "Kodansha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"}, {"mal_id": 460, "type": "anime", "name": "KlockWorx", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/460/KlockWorx"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 490, "type": "anime", "name": "Maiden Japan", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/490/Maiden_Japan"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 7, "type": "anime", "name": "J.C.Staff", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/7/JCStaff"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 50, "type": "anime", "name": "Adult Cast", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"}, {"mal_id": 57, "type": "anime", "name": "Gag Humor", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/57/Gag_Humor"}, {"mal_id": 20, "type": "anime", "name": "Parody", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/20/Parody"}, {"mal_id": 70, "type": "anime", "name": "Performing Arts", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/70/Performing_Arts"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]}, {"mal_id": 15699, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/15699/Haiyore_Nyaruko-san_W", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/47533.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/47533t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/47533l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/47533.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/47533t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/47533l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Haiyore!

Aoi valiantly refuses and decides to settle things on her own terms: she will pay off the debt herself by opening an eatery at Oodanna's inn.\n\nKakuriyo no Yadomeshi follows the journey of Aoi as she proceeds to change and touch the lives of the ayakashi through the one weapon she has against them\u2014her delicious cooking.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 2018, "broadcast": {"day": "Mondays", "time": "22:30", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Mondays at 22:30 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 276, "type": "anime", "name": "DLE", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/276/DLE"}, {"mal_id": 464, "type": "anime", "name": "flying DOG", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/464/flying_DOG"}, {"mal_id": 719, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio Mausu", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/719/Studio_Mausu"}, {"mal_id": 843, "type": "anime", "name": "BS Fuji", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/843/BS_Fuji"}, {"mal_id": 1211, "type": "anime", "name": "Tokyo MX", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1211/Tokyo_MX"}, {"mal_id": 1612, "type": "anime", "name": "NADA Holdings", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1612/NADA_Holdings"}, {"mal_id": 1696, "type": "anime", "name": "Kadokawa", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"}, {"mal_id": 1933, "type": "anime", "name": "Happinet", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1933/Happinet"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 3, "type": "anime", "name": "Gonzo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/3/Gonzo"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 47, "type": "anime", "name": "Gourmet", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/47/Gourmet"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 50, "type": "anime", "name": "Adult Cast", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"}, {"mal_id": 6, "type": "anime", "name": "Mythology", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/6/Mythology"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 58125, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/58125/Look_Back", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1716/142633.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1716/142633t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1716/142633l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1716/142633.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1716/142633t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1716/142633l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "gH6zVJVHEaM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH6zVJVHEaM", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/gH6zVJVHEaM?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/gH6zVJVHEaM/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/gH6zVJVHEaM/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/gH6zVJVHEaM/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/gH6zVJVHEaM/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/gH6zVJVHEaM/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Look Back"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30eb\u30c3\u30af\u30d0\u30c3\u30af"}], "title": "Look Back", "title_english": null, "title_japanese": "\u30eb\u30c3\u30af\u30d0\u30c3\u30af", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "Movie", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2024-06-28T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 28, "month": 6, "year": 2024}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Jun 28, 2024"}, "duration": "57 min", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 8.63, "scored_by": 102831, "rank": 86, "popularity": 1402, "members": 188360, "favorites": 3711, "synopsis": "Ayumu Fujino may only be in the fourth grade, but she already basks in high praise for her hand-drawn four-panel comics featured in the school's newspaper.

Otako is a plain-looking girl with a sarcastic personality and a rabid love of manga. And Ojou is a wealthy young lady with excellent social graces, though she can be a bit absent-minded at times. Despite their differences, the three are best friends, and together they love to talk about various myths and ask candid questions about the female body.\n \nOshiete!

Yet, when a concurrent Germanian transport mission goes awry, Izetta, the last witch alive, escapes. When she recognizes Princess Fin\u00e9 from her childhood, Izetta rescues her from the Germanian soldiers by making use of her magical abilities. Now reunited with the princess, Izetta pledges to protect Elystadt from Germania, and with the last surviving witch on their arsenal, Elystadt hopes to turn the tides against the imperialist war giant. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "fall", "year": 2016, "broadcast": {"day": "Saturdays", "time": "23:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Saturdays at 23:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 109, "type": "anime", "name": "Shochiku", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/109/Shochiku"}, {"mal_id": 238, "type": "anime", "name": "AT-X", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"}, {"mal_id": 406, "type": "anime", "name": "Asahi Production", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/406/Asahi_Production"}, {"mal_id": 464, "type": "anime", "name": "flying DOG", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/464/flying_DOG"}, {"mal_id": 1211, "type": "anime", "name": "Tokyo MX", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1211/Tokyo_MX"}, {"mal_id": 1331, "type": "anime", "name": "i0+", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1331/i0_"}, {"mal_id": 1537, "type": "anime", "name": "Wargaming Japan", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1537/Wargaming_Japan"}, {"mal_id": 1538, "type": "anime", "name": "JTB Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1538/JTB_Entertainment"}, {"mal_id": 1581, "type": "anime", "name": "RAY", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1581/RAY"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}, {"mal_id": 1468, "type": "anime", "name": "Crunchyroll", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1468/Crunchyroll"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 30, "type": "anime", "name": "Ajia-do", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/30/Ajia-do"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 13, "type": "anime", "name": "Historical", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}, {"mal_id": 38, "type": "anime", "name": "Military", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"}, {"mal_id": 82, "type": "anime", "name": "Urban Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/82/Urban_Fantasy"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 195, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/195/Onegai\u2606Teacher", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1371/138517.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1371/138517t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1371/138517l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1371/138517.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1371/138517t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1371/138517l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "edAOr7fhjAI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edAOr7fhjAI", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/edAOr7fhjAI?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/edAOr7fhjAI/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/edAOr7fhjAI/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/edAOr7fhjAI/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/edAOr7fhjAI/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/edAOr7fhjAI/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Onegai\u2606Teacher"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Onegai Sensei"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u304a\u306d\u304c\u3044\u2606\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Please Teacher!"}, {"type": "German", "title": "Onegai Teacher"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "Please Teacher!"}, {"type": "French", "title": "Please Teacher!"}], "title": "Onegai\u2606Teacher", "title_english": "Please Teacher!", "title_japanese": "\u304a\u306d\u304c\u3044\u2606\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc", "title_synonyms": ["Onegai Sensei"], "type": "TV", "source": "Original", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2002-01-10T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2002-03-28T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 10, "month": 1, "year": 2002}, "to": {"day": 28, "month": 3, "year": 2002}}, "string": "Jan 10, 2002 to Mar 28, 2002"}, "duration": "22 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.09, "scored_by": 98062, "rank": 4058, "popularity": 1425, "members": 185096, "favorites": 995, "synopsis": "One day, Kei Kusanagi notices a strange glowing woman by the lake.

Albatross pays a visit to the prison to meet an old friend, and Czeslaw Meyer runs into the man he hoped he would never see again.\n\nThese seemingly separate storylines merge, tying up several loose ends and revealing the whole truth of the anomaly that occurred aboard the Advena Avis in 1711.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "The Baccano!

Because of his brother Ayumu's weaker than average health, their parents thought it best for the family to move out from the city to a more rural environment. Now the two brothers are off to the Yorozuyo Inn where they\u2019ll be staying until their parents can settle affairs back in the city and set up their new home.\n\nTheir arrival to the inn doesn't go as planned though when they catch the wrong bus, wind up in the middle of nowhere, Ayumu gets his hat stolen by a wild monkey, and Kazuma gets lost in the woods trying to track the animal down. It all leads to a chance encounter with a spirited young girl named Ui, who Kazuma ends up accidentally falling onto and kissing while she tries leading him back to the bus stop. This hardly sits well with Ui\u2019s friend Ibuki who swiftly kicks Kazuma and sends him on his way. Much to Kazuma's continued horror, his bad luck is perpetuated at the inn thanks to its landlady Senka and her slightly perverted sense of humor, and then finding out that two of his classmates are the girls he embarrassed himself in front of back in the woods!\n\nHoshizora e Kakaru Hashi finds Kazuma adapting to his new school, dealing with the multiple women who have entered his life, providing emotional support for his younger brother, and coping with living with his new landlady. However, for some reason, something about this place is bringing whispers of the past into Kazuma's mind. Small flashes back to a more innocent time and a friendship long forgotten.

Despite the twists that may lie ahead, she will do whatever she can to protect those that she loves\u2014even if it means giving up on her dream.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Honzuki no Gekokujou: Shisho ni Naru Tame ni wa Shudan wo Erandeiraremasen 3rd Season was released on Blu-ray on June 8, 2022, and on DVD from April 20, 2022, to June 8, 2022.", "season": "spring", "year": 2022, "broadcast": {"day": "Tuesdays", "time": "02:29", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Tuesdays at 02:29 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 33, "type": "anime", "name": "WOWOW", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/33/WOWOW"}, {"mal_id": 460, "type": "anime", "name": "KlockWorx", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/460/KlockWorx"}, {"mal_id": 464, "type": "anime", "name": "flying DOG", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/464/flying_DOG"}, {"mal_id": 843, "type": "anime", "name": "BS Fuji", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/843/BS_Fuji"}, {"mal_id": 1492, "type": "anime", "name": "Yomiuri TV Enterprise", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1492/Yomiuri_TV_Enterprise"}, {"mal_id": 1988, "type": "anime", "name": "TO Books", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1988/TO_Books"}, {"mal_id": 1989, "type": "anime", "name": "JTB Next Creation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1989/JTB_Next_Creation"}, {"mal_id": 2222, "type": "anime", "name": "MediaNet Pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2222/MediaNet_Pictures"}, {"mal_id": 2431, "type": "anime", "name": "Happinet Phantom Studios", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2431/Happinet_Phantom_Studios"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 1468, "type": "anime", "name": "Crunchyroll", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1468/Crunchyroll"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 30, "type": "anime", "name": "Ajia-do", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/30/Ajia-do"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 62, "type": "anime", "name": "Isekai", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/62/Isekai"}, {"mal_id": 72, "type": "anime", "name": "Reincarnation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/72/Reincarnation"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 52308, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/52308/Kanojo_ga_Koushaku-tei_ni_Itta_Riyuu", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1109/130452.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1109/130452t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1109/130452l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1109/130452.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1109/130452t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1109/130452l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "MtpZJTTJEjA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtpZJTTJEjA", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/MtpZJTTJEjA?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/MtpZJTTJEjA/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/MtpZJTTJEjA/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/MtpZJTTJEjA/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/MtpZJTTJEjA/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/MtpZJTTJEjA/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Kanojo ga Koushaku-tei ni Itta Riyuu"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Geunyeoga Gongjagjeolo Gaya Haessdeon Sajeong"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "\uadf8\ub140\uac00 \uacf5\uc791\uc800\ub85c \uac00\uc57c \ud588\ub358 \uc0ac\uc815"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u5f7c\u5973\u304c\u516c\u7235\u90b8\u306b\u884c\u3063\u305f\u7406\u7531"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Why Raeliana Ended up at the Duke's Mansion"}], "title": "Kanojo ga Koushaku-tei ni Itta Riyuu", "title_english": "Why Raeliana Ended up at the Duke's Mansion", "title_japanese": "\u5f7c\u5973\u304c\u516c\u7235\u90b8\u306b\u884c\u3063\u305f\u7406\u7531", "title_synonyms": ["Geunyeoga Gongjagjeolo Gaya Haessdeon Sajeong", "\uadf8\ub140\uac00 \uacf5\uc791\uc800\ub85c \uac00\uc57c \ud588\ub358 \uc0ac\uc815"], "type": "TV", "source": "Web manga", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2023-04-10T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2023-06-26T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 10, "month": 4, "year": 2023}, "to": {"day": 26, "month": 6, "year": 2023}}, "string": "Apr 10, 2023 to Jun 26, 2023"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.53, "scored_by": 83920, "rank": 1907, "popularity": 1443, "members": 182181, "favorites": 1635, "synopsis": "When, after her sudden death, Rinko Hanasaki is reborn as Raeliana McMillan, she is not sure whether to curse her luck.

After escaping an attack and stumbling upon a decrepit village of underworld residents, he begins his adventure across the different planets of this strange universe to find out more about his own identity and the woman he once knew.\n\nThrough a journey of self-discovery and acceptance, Kaiba weaves together tales of souls and spirits and explores the importance of memories.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "The series received an Excellence Prize for animation at the 2008 Japan Media Arts Festival.", "season": "spring", "year": 2008, "broadcast": {"day": "Fridays", "time": "00:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Fridays at 00:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 29, "type": "anime", "name": "VAP", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/29/VAP"}, {"mal_id": 33, "type": "anime", "name": "WOWOW", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/33/WOWOW"}, {"mal_id": 3104, "type": "anime", "name": "Mediarte Entertainment Works", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/3104/Mediarte_Entertainment_Works"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 467, "type": "anime", "name": "Discotek Media", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/467/Discotek_Media"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 11, "type": "anime", "name": "Madhouse", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/11/Madhouse"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 5, "type": "anime", "name": "Avant Garde", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/5/Avant_Garde"}, {"mal_id": 46, "type": "anime", "name": "Award Winning", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/46/Award_Winning"}, {"mal_id": 7, "type": "anime", "name": "Mystery", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 40, "type": "anime", "name": "Psychological", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 25015, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/25015/Kyoukai_no_Kanata_Movie_1__Ill_Be_Here_-_Kako-hen", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/73298.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/73298t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/73298l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/73298.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/73298t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/73298l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "y6I_QK9oBSI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6I_QK9oBSI", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/y6I_QK9oBSI?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/y6I_QK9oBSI/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/y6I_QK9oBSI/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/y6I_QK9oBSI/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/y6I_QK9oBSI/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/y6I_QK9oBSI/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Kyoukai no Kanata Movie 1: I'll Be Here - Kako-hen"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Beyond the Boundary Movie"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Kyokai no Kanata Movie"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u5287\u5834\u7248 \u5883\u754c\u306e\u5f7c\u65b9 I'LL BE HERE \u904e\u53bb\u7bc7"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Beyond the Boundary: I'll Be Here - Past"}], "title": "Kyoukai no Kanata Movie 1: I'll Be Here - Kako-hen", "title_english": "Beyond the Boundary: I'll Be Here - Past", "title_japanese": "\u5287\u5834\u7248 \u5883\u754c\u306e\u5f7c\u65b9 I'LL BE HERE \u904e\u53bb\u7bc7", "title_synonyms": ["Beyond the Boundary Movie", "Kyokai no Kanata Movie"], "type": "Movie", "source": "Light novel", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2015-03-14T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 14, "month": 3, "year": 2015}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Mar 14, 2015"}, "duration": "1 hr 22 min", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.72, "scored_by": 79047, "rank": 1271, "popularity": 1502, "members": 174650, "favorites": 268, "synopsis": "The first part of a two-part movie.

With her new heavenly ability and the fox spirit Kon, Inari forms a sincere friendship with Uka-sama, encounters more of the supernatural world, and learns that true love knows no bounds.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "winter", "year": 2014, "broadcast": {"day": "Wednesdays", "time": "01:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Wednesdays at 01:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 113, "type": "anime", "name": "Kadokawa Shoten", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/113/Kadokawa_Shoten"}, {"mal_id": 315, "type": "anime", "name": "DAX Production", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/315/DAX_Production"}, {"mal_id": 460, "type": "anime", "name": "KlockWorx", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/460/KlockWorx"}, {"mal_id": 464, "type": "anime", "name": "flying DOG", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/464/flying_DOG"}, {"mal_id": 1551, "type": "anime", "name": "Kadokawa Media House", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1551/Kadokawa_Media_House"}, {"mal_id": 2545, "type": "anime", "name": "Kyoto Broadcasting System", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2545/Kyoto_Broadcasting_System"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 1053, "type": "anime", "name": "Production IMS", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1053/Production_IMS"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}, {"mal_id": 37, "type": "anime", "name": "Supernatural", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 6, "type": "anime", "name": "Mythology", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/6/Mythology"}, {"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 42, "type": "anime", "name": "Seinen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]}, {"mal_id": 23333, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/23333/DRAMAtical_Murder", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/75642.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/75642t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/75642l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/75642.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/75642t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/75642l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "PLi1o7kkGm4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLi1o7kkGm4", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/PLi1o7kkGm4?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/PLi1o7kkGm4/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/PLi1o7kkGm4/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/PLi1o7kkGm4/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/PLi1o7kkGm4/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/PLi1o7kkGm4/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "DRAMAtical Murder"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "DMMd"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30c9\u30e9\u30de\u30c6\u30a3\u30ab\u30eb \u30de\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc"}, {"type": "English", "title": "DRAMAtical Murder"}], "title": "DRAMAtical Murder", "title_english": "DRAMAtical Murder", "title_japanese": "\u30c9\u30e9\u30de\u30c6\u30a3\u30ab\u30eb \u30de\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc", "title_synonyms": ["DMMd"], "type": "TV", "source": "Visual novel", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2014-07-07T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2014-09-22T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 7, "month": 7, "year": 2014}, "to": {"day": 22, "month": 9, "year": 2014}}, "string": "Jul 7, 2014 to Sep 22, 2014"}, "duration": "24 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 6.04, "scored_by": 76060, "rank": 9958, "popularity": 1515, "members": 173594, "favorites": 626, "synopsis": "Some time ago, the influential and powerful Toue Inc. bought the island of Midorijima, Japan, with the plans of building Platinum Jail\u2014a luxurious utopian facility.

They decide to explore the lost and broken landscape together, questioning each other about the nature of faith, the purpose of the world, and the origins of their lives.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "When it was brought to the US, 45 minutes of live action footage was added in an attempt to release it as a post-apocalyptic thriller called In The Aftermath: Angels Never Sleep.", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 382, "type": "anime", "name": "Tokuma Shoten", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/382/Tokuma_Shoten"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 488, "type": "anime", "name": "Anchor Bay Films", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/488/Anchor_Bay_Films"}, {"mal_id": 783, "type": "anime", "name": "GKIDS", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/783/GKIDS"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 37, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio Deen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/37/Studio_Deen"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 5, "type": "anime", "name": "Avant Garde", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/5/Avant_Garde"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 50481, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/50481/Eiyuuou_Bu_wo_Kiwameru_Tame_Tenseisu__Soshite_Sekai_Saikyou_no_Minarai_Kishi\u2640", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1044/129594.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1044/129594t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1044/129594l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1044/129594.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1044/129594t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1044/129594l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "TroQ3-AtG70", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TroQ3-AtG70", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/TroQ3-AtG70?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/TroQ3-AtG70/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/TroQ3-AtG70/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/TroQ3-AtG70/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/TroQ3-AtG70/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/TroQ3-AtG70/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Eiyuuou, Bu wo Kiwameru Tame Tenseisu: Soshite, Sekai Saikyou no Minarai Kishi\u2640"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u82f1\u96c4\u738b\u3001\u6b66\u3092\u6975\u3081\u308b\u305f\u3081\u8ee2\u751f\u3059 \uff5e\u305d\u3057\u3066\u3001\u4e16\u754c\u6700\u5f37\u306e\u898b\u7fd2\u3044\u9a0e\u58eb\u2640\uff5e"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Reborn to Master the Blade: From Hero-King to Extraordinary Squire \u2640"}], "title": "Eiyuuou, Bu wo Kiwameru Tame Tenseisu: Soshite, Sekai Saikyou no Minarai Kishi\u2640", "title_english": "Reborn to Master the Blade: From Hero-King to Extraordinary Squire \u2640", "title_japanese": "\u82f1\u96c4\u738b\u3001\u6b66\u3092\u6975\u3081\u308b\u305f\u3081\u8ee2\u751f\u3059 \uff5e\u305d\u3057\u3066\u3001\u4e16\u754c\u6700\u5f37\u306e\u898b\u7fd2\u3044\u9a0e\u58eb\u2640\uff5e", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "TV", "source": "Light novel", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2023-01-10T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2023-03-28T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 10, "month": 1, "year": 2023}, "to": {"day": 28, "month": 3, "year": 2023}}, "string": "Jan 10, 2023 to Mar 28, 2023"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 6.56, "scored_by": 77505, "rank": 6854, "popularity": 1551, "members": 169629, "favorites": 638, "synopsis": "The hero-king Inglis\u2014who dedicated his entire life to building his country\u2014is now approaching death.

Since then, the space race between the confederacy and its competitor, the United Kingdom of Arnack, has intensified; the two countries hope to one day send humans to the cosmos above.\n\nAs a dog's biology is inherently different from a human's anatomy, there is no way to perfectly identify the risks involving space travel and its effects on an individual's body without actually sending someone for observation. However, Zirnitra's government has a potential solution: to experiment on vampires, whose biological similarity to humans is too significant to ignore.\n\nDespite being forcibly taken from her home in the mountains, vampire Irina Luminesk shows no resistance and is even willing to train as a test subject. Lev Leps, a former top candidate to become the first human cosmonaut, is designated to accompany Irina and act as her guide. Through their time together, Irina and Lev begin to develop a mutual love for outer space, bringing them closer together.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Tsuki to Laika to Nosferatu was released on Blu-ray from January 26, 2022 to March 29, 2022.", "season": "fall", "year": 2021, "broadcast": {"day": "Sundays", "time": "01:35", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Sundays at 01:35 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 1430, "type": "anime", "name": "Shogakukan", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1430/Shogakukan"}, {"mal_id": 1469, "type": "anime", "name": "BS TV Tokyo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1469/BS_TV_Tokyo"}, {"mal_id": 1840, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai Namco Arts", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1840/Bandai_Namco_Arts"}, {"mal_id": 2232, "type": "anime", "name": "ADK Marketing Solutions", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2232/ADK_Marketing_Solutions"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 1874, "type": "anime", "name": "Arvo Animation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1874/Arvo_Animation"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 13, "type": "anime", "name": "Historical", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}, {"mal_id": 38, "type": "anime", "name": "Military", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"}, {"mal_id": 29, "type": "anime", "name": "Space", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/29/Space"}, {"mal_id": 82, "type": "anime", "name": "Urban Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/82/Urban_Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 32, "type": "anime", "name": "Vampire", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/32/Vampire"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 39456, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/39456/Sounan_desu_ka", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1741/102237.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1741/102237t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1741/102237l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1741/102237.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1741/102237t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1741/102237l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "wwP8TQE2P0c", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwP8TQE2P0c", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/wwP8TQE2P0c?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/wwP8TQE2P0c/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/wwP8TQE2P0c/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/wwP8TQE2P0c/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/wwP8TQE2P0c/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/wwP8TQE2P0c/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Sounan desu ka?"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30bd\u30a6\u30ca\u30f3\u3067\u3059\u304b?"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Are You Lost?"}, {"type": "German", "title": "Are You Lost?"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "Are You Lost?"}, {"type": "French", "title": "Are You Lost?"}], "title": "Sounan desu ka?", "title_english": "Are You Lost?", "title_japanese": "\u30bd\u30a6\u30ca\u30f3\u3067\u3059\u304b?", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "TV", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2019-07-02T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2019-09-17T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 2, "month": 7, "year": 2019}, "to": {"day": 17, "month": 9, "year": 2019}}, "string": "Jul 2, 2019 to Sep 17, 2019"}, "duration": "12 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 6.59, "scored_by": 79246, "rank": 6689, "popularity": 1561, "members": 168614, "favorites": 263, "synopsis": "After a school trip goes terribly wrong, Homare Onishima, Shion Kujou, Asuka Suzumori, and Mutsu Amatani are left stranded on a deserted island.

Together with her new accomplices, Lucifer sets out on a mission to subdue the Seven Sins so she may be free of the curse brought upon by her Garb.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 2017, "broadcast": {"day": "Saturdays", "time": "00:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Saturdays at 00:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 79, "type": "anime", "name": "Genco", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/79/Genco"}, {"mal_id": 104, "type": "anime", "name": "Lantis", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/104/Lantis"}, {"mal_id": 238, "type": "anime", "name": "AT-X", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"}, {"mal_id": 547, "type": "anime", "name": "Hobby Japan", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/547/Hobby_Japan"}, {"mal_id": 1113, "type": "anime", "name": "NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1113/NBCUniversal_Entertainment_Japan"}, {"mal_id": 1494, "type": "anime", "name": "Kanon Sound", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1494/Kanon_Sound"}, {"mal_id": 1654, "type": "anime", "name": "Orchid Seed", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1654/Orchid_Seed"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Artland", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/8/Artland"}, {"mal_id": 120, "type": "anime", "name": "TNK", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/120/TNK"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 49, "type": "anime", "name": "Erotica", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/49/Erotica"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 24705, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/24705/Ore_Twintail_ni_Narimasu", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/75057.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/75057t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/75057l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/75057.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/75057t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/75057l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "b5iS_9oQJlU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5iS_9oQJlU", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/b5iS_9oQJlU?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/b5iS_9oQJlU/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/b5iS_9oQJlU/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/b5iS_9oQJlU/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/b5iS_9oQJlU/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/b5iS_9oQJlU/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Ore, Twintail ni Narimasu."}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Ore"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Twin tails ni Narimasu."}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u4ffa\u3001\u30c4\u30a4\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30eb\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Gonna be the Twin-Tail!!"}, {"type": "German", "title": "Gonna be the Twin-Tail!!"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "Ore, Twintails ni Narimasu"}, {"type": "French", "title": "Gonna Be the Twin-Tail!!"}], "title": "Ore, Twintail ni Narimasu.", "title_english": "Gonna be the Twin-Tail!!", "title_japanese": "\u4ffa\u3001\u30c4\u30a4\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30eb\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002", "title_synonyms": ["Ore", "Twin tails ni Narimasu."], "type": "TV", "source": "Light novel", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2014-10-10T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2014-12-26T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 10, "month": 10, "year": 2014}, "to": {"day": 26, "month": 12, "year": 2014}}, "string": "Oct 10, 2014 to Dec 26, 2014"}, "duration": "24 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 6.42, "scored_by": 68583, "rank": 7765, "popularity": 1569, "members": 166969, "favorites": 563, "synopsis": "Twintails: the glory of all mankind\u2014or at least that is what first-year high school student Souji Mitsuka believes.

However, Banba might not be the only one with a bone to pick with these organizations, as Xianming Lin, a crossdressing male hitman in the employ of one such company begins getting fed up with his lack of jobs and pay.\n\nOne day, after Lin's current target commits suicide before the hitman could reach him, his company refuses to pay him even half the amount they were originally supposed to for the assassination. Frustrated, Lin requests another mission and is offered the job of taking out Banba, whom his organization believes has been interfering with their business.
