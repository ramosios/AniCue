Now a highschooler but as enthusiastic as ever, Kohane wants nothing more than to start her very own cheerleading squad. She is encouraged by her best friend, Uki Sawatari, who often has to help her get out of trouble.\n\nThere is just one problem: Kohane does not have any experience in cheerleading.

Having given up on competing, he enrolls in Kotesashi High School\u2014a completely average public school with no baseball team to speak of\u2014where he discovers that his new classmates are the legendary pair who once destroyed his dreams. Adding to this shocking revelation, he learns that amnesia has reduced the once level-headed General to a vulgar class clown. Having lost all interest in baseball, Kaname dragged a disappointed Kiyomine to Kotesashi simply because the school was close to where they live.\n\nAs Kotesashi forms a fledgling baseball club, Yamada meets other players he once admired who also left baseball behind. While they might be unwilling now, Yamada believes that if he can convince such talented athletes to start playing again, it might be possible to achieve their dreams and win the national championship\u2014as long as they can put up with Kaname's incessant joking.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 2024, "broadcast": {"day": "Wednesdays", "time": "00:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Wednesdays at 00:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 1696, "type": "anime", "name": "Kadokawa", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"}, {"mal_id": 1856, "type": "anime", "name": "dugout", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1856/dugout"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 569, "type": "anime", "name": "MAPPA", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/569/MAPPA"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 30, "type": "anime", "name": "Sports", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/30/Sports"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}, {"mal_id": 77, "type": "anime", "name": "Team Sports", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/77/Team_Sports"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]}, {"mal_id": 59828, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/59828/Shoushimin_Series_2nd_Season", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1224/148321.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1224/148321t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1224/148321l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1224/148321.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1224/148321t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1224/148321l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "FTj4bFTGJCk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTj4bFTGJCk", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/FTj4bFTGJCk?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/FTj4bFTGJCk/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/FTj4bFTGJCk/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/FTj4bFTGJCk/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/FTj4bFTGJCk/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/FTj4bFTGJCk/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Shoushimin Series 2nd Season"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u5c0f\u5e02\u6c11\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba \u7b2c2\u671f"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Shoshimin: How to Become Ordinary Season 2"}], "title": "Shoushimin Series 2nd Season", "title_english": "Shoshimin: How to Become Ordinary Season 2", "title_japanese": "\u5c0f\u5e02\u6c11\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba \u7b2c2\u671f", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "TV", "source": "Novel", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2025-04-06T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2025-06-22T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 6, "month": 4, "year": 2025}, "to": {"day": 22, "month": 6, "year": 2025}}, "string": "Apr 6, 2025 to Jun 22, 2025"}, "duration": "22 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 8.06, "scored_by": 18783, "rank": 601, "popularity": 3610, "members": 45922, "favorites": 280, "synopsis": "First-year student Takahiko Urino aspires to write something truly original for the school newspaper, Furnado Monthly.

However, she will soon realize that it takes more than just making delicious sweets to open up a shop.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "fall", "year": 2010, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": "Unknown"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio Pierrot", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1/Studio_Pierrot"}, {"mal_id": 1365, "type": "anime", "name": "Shueisha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1365/Shueisha"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 490, "type": "anime", "name": "Maiden Japan", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/490/Maiden_Japan"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 101, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio Hibari", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/101/Studio_Hibari"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 47, "type": "anime", "name": "Gourmet", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/47/Gourmet"}, {"mal_id": 36, "type": "anime", "name": "Slice of Life", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 25, "type": "anime", "name": "Shoujo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo"}]}, {"mal_id": 60334, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/60334/Anne_Shirley", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1564/150049.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1564/150049t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1564/150049l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1564/150049.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1564/150049t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1564/150049l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "GXUaLD071as", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXUaLD071as", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/GXUaLD071as?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/GXUaLD071as/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/GXUaLD071as/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/GXUaLD071as/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/GXUaLD071as/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/GXUaLD071as/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Anne Shirley"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30a2\u30f3\u30fb\u30b7\u30e3\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Anne Shirley"}], "title": "Anne Shirley", "title_english": "Anne Shirley", "title_japanese": "\u30a2\u30f3\u30fb\u30b7\u30e3\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "TV", "source": "Novel", "episodes": 24, "status": "Currently Airing", "airing": true, "aired": {"from": "2025-04-05T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 5, "month": 4, "year": 2025}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Apr 5, 2025 to ?"}, "duration": "24 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.77, "scored_by": 7146, "rank": 1152, "popularity": 3690, "members": 44235, "favorites": 198, "synopsis": "Eleven-year-old orphan Anne Shirley has spent her life moving from one family to another, always hoping to find a place where she truly belongs.

However, there is a saying: \"there are no secrets that time cannot reveal.\" In time, Hime must learn the reality behind the things she took for granted as she grew up.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 719, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio Mausu", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/719/Studio_Mausu"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 30, "type": "anime", "name": "Ajia-do", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/30/Ajia-do"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 53, "type": "anime", "name": "Childcare", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/53/Childcare"}, {"mal_id": 57, "type": "anime", "name": "Gag Humor", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/57/Gag_Humor"}, {"mal_id": 69, "type": "anime", "name": "Otaku Culture", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/69/Otaku_Culture"}, {"mal_id": 48, "type": "anime", "name": "Workplace", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/48/Workplace"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]}, {"mal_id": 3464, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/3464/Kemeko_Deluxe", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/75538.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/75538t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/75538l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/75538.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/75538t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/75538l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Kemeko Deluxe!"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "The Unknown Girlfriend"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Kemeko DX"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30b1\u30e1\u30b3\u30c7\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\uff01"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "Kemeko DX"}], "title": "Kemeko Deluxe!", "title_english": null, "title_japanese": "\u30b1\u30e1\u30b3\u30c7\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\uff01", "title_synonyms": ["The Unknown Girlfriend", "Kemeko DX"], "type": "TV", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2008-10-05T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2008-12-21T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 5, "month": 10, "year": 2008}, "to": {"day": 21, "month": 12, "year": 2008}}, "string": "Oct 5, 2008 to Dec 21, 2008"}, "duration": "24 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 6.53, "scored_by": 17801, "rank": 7059, "popularity": 3706, "members": 43869, "favorites": 59, "synopsis": "When Sanpeita Kobayashi was a child, his lovely friend had to move away, but she vowed that in ten years, they would meet again\u2014as husband and wife.

Resolving to defeat this phantom, Keisuke mobilizes the Akagi Red Suns to take on the local Akina Speed Stars racing team in an exchange race. He anticipates that the competition will lure the elusive \"Ghost of Akina\" out into the open and give him the opportunity to exact revenge for his previous defeat. \n\nWhile his friend Itsuki Takeuchi is obsessed with cars and racing, Takumi Fujiwara is not. He fails to understand the \"rush\" that racers experience and any talk of cars reminds him of the tofu deliveries he makes for his father in an old AE86. His early morning routine takes him up and down Mount Akina, where he has memorized every hairpin, brake point, and turn better than anyone else. \n\nWhen the Akagi team appears one night to challenge the Speed Stars to an exchange race, they accept the challenge only to find out that they are completely outclassed. The only way the Speed Stars can stand a chance against them is if they can get the panda-colored AE86 to join their team. With a bit of coercion, Takumi takes the wheel of the AE86 and heads off to Mount Akina to defend the pride of all racers in Akina.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "New Initial D Movie: Legend 1 -

After the disaster, these machines now service the city as cheap labor. Genom Corporation is the mastermind behind the boomers, having become so rich and powerful that they have extended its influence into space.\n\nHowever, all is not well with the boomers. Random breakdowns in their neural structure are causing some of them to go berserk, destroying property and killing humans in violent rampages. To combat this, Tokyo has formed the Advanced Police, a peacekeeping force with jurisdiction over boomer matters. There are also rumors of a second group known as the Knight Sabers, a vigilante unit operating from the shadows.\n\nTrying to investigate the Knight Sabers, the adventurous Linna Yamazaki travels to Tokyo in pursuit of her heroes.

Figuring out how to dismantle Kise's \"Perfect Copy\" will be the key to Seirin's victory, but this may be a tall order when they realize that Kaijou's star has learned to copy the other Miracles' playstyles.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Production I.G", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 30, "type": "anime", "name": "Sports", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/30/Sports"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}, {"mal_id": 77, "type": "anime", "name": "Team Sports", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/77/Team_Sports"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]}, {"mal_id": 54883, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/54883/Mononogatari_2nd_Season", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1111/135927.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1111/135927t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1111/135927l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1111/135927.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1111/135927t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1111/135927l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "sMU9JX2nGHE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMU9JX2nGHE", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/sMU9JX2nGHE?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/sMU9JX2nGHE/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/sMU9JX2nGHE/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/sMU9JX2nGHE/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/sMU9JX2nGHE/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/sMU9JX2nGHE/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Mononogatari 2nd Season"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u3082\u306e\u306e\u304c\u305f\u308a \u7b2c\u4e8c\u7ae0"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Malevolent Spirits: Mononogatari 2nd Season"}], "title": "Mononogatari 2nd Season", "title_english": "Malevolent Spirits: Mononogatari 2nd Season", "title_japanese": "\u3082\u306e\u306e\u304c\u305f\u308a \u7b2c\u4e8c\u7ae0", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "TV", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2023-07-04T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2023-09-19T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 4, "month": 7, "year": 2023}, "to": {"day": 19, "month": 9, "year": 2023}}, "string": "Jul 4, 2023 to Sep 19, 2023"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.33, "scored_by": 17022, "rank": 2736, "popularity": 3823, "members": 41548, "favorites": 111, "synopsis": "Although Hyouma Kunato has begun to feel comfortable around Botan Nagatsuki and her family of tsukumogami\u2014objects possessed by spirits called marebito\u2014he has not forgotten about his main goal in life: revenge.\n\nUnbeknownst to Hyouma, while he is training in Kyoto under the supervision of the Kadomori family, the Bureau of Traditional Music, a group of three musical instrument tsukumogami, begins to enact its plan.

Seeking to defend democracy and restore the Alliance constitution, Admiral Yang Wen-li faces off against his fellow citizens\u2014and, regrettably, the father of his devoted adjutant Lieutenant Frederica Greenhill.\n\nNow with the Free Planets Alliance thoroughly occupied with their own internal matters, the forces of the Galactic Empire can safely suppress the newly formed Lippstadt League led by Duke Otto von Braunschweig.

This whimsical place, oddly lacking in food and running water but full of electrical sockets, is home to a petulant girl in a mask, named Wolf Queen and becomes their playground and refuge during school hours. Hidden within the walls, they're told there's a key that will grant one wish, as well as a set of clues to find it. But there's a catch: the key must be found by the end of the school year and they must leave the premises by five o'clock each day or else suffer a fatal end.\n\nAs time passes, a devastating truth emerges: only those brave enough to share their stories will be saved. And so they begin to unlock each other's stories: how a boy is showered with more gadgets than love; how another suffers a painful and unexplained rejection, and how a girl lives in fear of her predatory stepfather. As they struggle to abide by the rules of the game, a moving story unfolds, of seven characters trapped in a cycle of misunderstanding and loneliness, who are ultimately set free by the power of friendship, empathy, and sacrifice. \n\n(Source: Erewhon Books, edited)", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Production I.G", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"}, {"mal_id": 17, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"}, {"mal_id": 76, "type": "anime", "name": "Yomiuri Telecasting", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/76/Yomiuri_Telecasting"}, {"mal_id": 109, "type": "anime", "name": "Shochiku", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/109/Shochiku"}, {"mal_id": 1003, "type": "anime", "name": "Nippon Television Network", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1003/Nippon_Television_Network"}, {"mal_id": 1698, "type": "anime", "name": "Sapporo Television Broadcasting", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1698/Sapporo_Television_Broadcasting"}, {"mal_id": 1699, "type": "anime", "name": "Miyagi Television Broadcasting", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1699/Miyagi_Television_Broadcasting"}, {"mal_id": 1700, "type": "anime", "name": "Shizuoka Daiichi Television", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1700/Shizuoka_Daiichi_Television"}, {"mal_id": 1701, "type": "anime", "name": "Chukyo TV Broadcasting", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1701/Chukyo_TV_Broadcasting"}, {"mal_id": 1702, "type": "anime", "name": "Hiroshima Television", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1702/Hiroshima_Television"}, {"mal_id": 1703, "type": "anime", "name": "Fukuoka Broadcasting System", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1703/Fukuoka_Broadcasting_System"}, {"mal_id": 2423, "type": "anime", "name": "Poplar Publishing", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2423/Poplar_Publishing"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 783, "type": "anime", "name": "GKIDS", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/783/GKIDS"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 56, "type": "anime", "name": "A-1 Pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/56/A-1_Pictures"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 7, "type": "anime", "name": "Mystery", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 37599, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/37599/Magatsu_Wahrheit__Zuerst", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1109/108983.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1109/108983t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1109/108983l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1109/108983.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1109/108983t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1109/108983l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "3VyUAlzY2JA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VyUAlzY2JA", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/3VyUAlzY2JA?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/3VyUAlzY2JA/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/3VyUAlzY2JA/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/3VyUAlzY2JA/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/3VyUAlzY2JA/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/3VyUAlzY2JA/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Magatsu Wahrheit: Zuerst"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "MWZ"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u798d\u3064\u30f4\u30a1\u30fc\u30eb\u30cf\u30a4\u30c8 -ZUERST-"}, {"type": "English", "title": "MAGATSU WAHRHEIT"}], "title": "Magatsu Wahrheit: Zuerst", "title_english": "MAGATSU WAHRHEIT", "title_japanese": "\u798d\u3064\u30f4\u30a1\u30fc\u30eb\u30cf\u30a4\u30c8 -ZUERST-", "title_synonyms": ["MWZ"], "type": "TV", "source": "Game", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2020-10-13T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2020-12-29T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 13, "month": 10, "year": 2020}, "to": {"day": 29, "month": 12, "year": 2020}}, "string": "Oct 13, 2020 to Dec 29, 2020"}, "duration": "24 min per ep", "rating": "R -
