What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal Titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.\n\nAfter witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures, Eren Yeager dedicates his life to their eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls. Eren, his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman, and his childhood friend Armin Arlert join the brutal war against the Titans and race to discover a way of defeating them before the last walls are breached.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Shingeki no Kyojin adapts content from the first eight volumes of Hajime Isayama's award-winning manga of the same name.

With the release of this worldwide sensation, gaming has never felt more lifelike.\n\nHowever, the idyllic fantasy rapidly becomes a brutal nightmare when SAO's creator traps thousands of players inside the game. The \"log-out\" function has been removed, with the only method of escape involving beating all of Aincrad's one hundred increasingly difficult levels. Adding to the struggle, any in-game death becomes permanent, ending the player's life in the real world.\n\nWhile Kazuto \"Kirito\" Kirigaya was fortunate enough to be a beta-tester for the game, he quickly finds that despite his advantages, he cannot overcome SAO's challenges alone. Teaming up with Asuna Yuuki and other talented players, Kirito makes an effort to face the seemingly insurmountable trials head-on. But with difficult bosses and threatening dark cults impeding his progress, Kirito finds that such tasks are much easier said than done.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "summer", "year": 2012, "broadcast": {"day": "Sundays", "time": "00:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Sundays at 00:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 17, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"}, {"mal_id": 79, "type": "anime", "name": "Genco", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/79/Genco"}, {"mal_id": 315, "type": "anime", "name": "DAX Production", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/315/DAX_Production"}, {"mal_id": 681, "type": "anime", "name": "ASCII Media Works", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/681/ASCII_Media_Works"}, {"mal_id": 1097, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai Namco Games", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1097/Bandai_Namco_Games"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 493, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex of America", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/493/Aniplex_of_America"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 56, "type": "anime", "name": "A-1 Pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/56/A-1_Pictures"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 64, "type": "anime", "name": "Love Polygon", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/64/Love_Polygon"}, {"mal_id": 79, "type": "anime", "name": "Video Game", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/79/Video_Game"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 31964, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/31964/Boku_no_Hero_Academia", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/78745.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/78745t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/78745l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/78745.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/78745t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/78745l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "D5fYOnwYkj4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5fYOnwYkj4", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/D5fYOnwYkj4?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/D5fYOnwYkj4/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/D5fYOnwYkj4/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/D5fYOnwYkj4/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/D5fYOnwYkj4/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/D5fYOnwYkj4/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Boku no Hero Academia"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u50d5\u306e\u30d2\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc\u30a2\u30ab\u30c7\u30df\u30a2"}, {"type": "English", "title": "My Hero Academia"}, {"type": "German", "title": "My Hero Academia"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "My Hero Academia"}, {"type": "French", "title": "My Hero Academia"}], "title": "Boku no Hero Academia", "title_english": "My Hero Academia", "title_japanese": "\u50d5\u306e\u30d2\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc\u30a2\u30ab\u30c7\u30df\u30a2", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "TV", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 13, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2016-04-03T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2016-06-26T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 3, "month": 4, "year": 2016}, "to": {"day": 26, "month": 6, "year": 2016}}, "string": "Apr 3, 2016 to Jun 26, 2016"}, "duration": "24 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.83, "scored_by": 2174229, "rank": 1016, "popularity": 7, "members": 3201351, "favorites": 54025, "synopsis": "The appearance of \"quirks,\" newly discovered super powers, has been steadily increasing over the years, with 80 percent of humanity possessing various abilities from manipulation of elements to shapeshifting.

In June 2004, One Piece was licensed in North America by 4Kids Entertainment, which partnered with Viz Media for home video distribution. As One Piece proved unsuitable for their target demographic, 4Kids Entertainment censored the show to meet their standards, and, in December 2006, they stopped its production. In April 2007, Funimation took over the series licensing, providing an uncut version that remained faithful to the original release. In Japan, the anime's first 574 episodes were released exclusively on DVD by Avex Pictures from February 21, 2001, to December 4, 2013.

Ten years later, the Holy Knights themselves staged a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, and thus became the new, tyrannical rulers of the Kingdom of Liones.\n\nBased on the best-selling manga series of the same name, Nanatsu no Taizai follows the adventures of Elizabeth, the third princess of the Kingdom of Liones, and her search for the Seven Deadly Sins. With their help, she endeavors to not only take back her kingdom from the Holy Knights, but to also seek justice in an unjust world.\n \n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "fall", "year": 2014, "broadcast": {"day": "Sundays", "time": "17:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Sundays at 17:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 17, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"}, {"mal_id": 53, "type": "anime", "name": "Dentsu", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/53/Dentsu"}, {"mal_id": 143, "type": "anime", "name": "Mainichi Broadcasting System", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"}, {"mal_id": 159, "type": "anime", "name": "Kodansha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"}, {"mal_id": 166, "type": "anime", "name": "Movic", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 56, "type": "anime", "name": "A-1 Pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/56/A-1_Pictures"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]}, {"mal_id": 24833, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/24833/Ansatsu_Kyoushitsu", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/75639.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/75639t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/75639l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/75639.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/75639t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/75639l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "kgNkGohA20k", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgNkGohA20k", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/kgNkGohA20k?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/kgNkGohA20k/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/kgNkGohA20k/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/kgNkGohA20k/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/kgNkGohA20k/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/kgNkGohA20k/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Ansatsu Kyoushitsu"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u6697\u6bba\u6559\u5ba4"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Assassination Classroom"}, {"type": "German", "title": "Assassination Classroom"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "Assassination Classroom"}, {"type": "French", "title": "Assassination Classroom"}], "title": "Ansatsu Kyoushitsu", "title_english": "Assassination Classroom", "title_japanese": "\u6697\u6bba\u6559\u5ba4", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "TV", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 22, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2015-01-10T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2015-06-20T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 10, "month": 1, "year": 2015}, "to": {"day": 20, "month": 6, "year": 2015}}, "string": "Jan 10, 2015 to Jun 20, 2015"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 8.07, "scored_by": 1266650, "rank": 589, "popularity": 34, "members": 2148587, "favorites": 30919, "synopsis": "Tucked in the mountains near the elite Kunugigaoka Middle School lies a small derelict building that houses the delinquents and dropouts of Class 3-E.

Satellite channel WOWOW picked up the series in the fall of that year and aired it in its entirety uncensored. Cowboy Bebop was not a ratings hit in Japan, but sold over 19,000 DVD units in the initial release run, and 81,000 overall.

Mankind is unable to defend themselves against the Angels despite utilizing their most advanced munitions and military tactics. The only hope for human salvation rests in the hands of NERV, a mysterious organization led by the cold Gendou Ikari. NERV operates giant humanoid robots dubbed \"Evangelions\" to combat the Angels with state-of-the-art advanced weaponry and protective barriers known as Absolute Terror Fields.\n\nYears after being abandoned by his father, Shinji Ikari, Gendou's 14-year-old son, returns to Tokyo-3. Shinji undergoes a perpetual internal battle against the deeply buried trauma caused by the loss of his mother and the emotional neglect he suffered at the hands of his father. Terrified to open himself up to another, Shinji's life is forever changed upon meeting 29-year-old Misato Katsuragi, a high-ranking NERV officer who shows him a free-spirited maternal kindness he has never experienced.\n\nA devastating Angel attack forces Shinji into action as Gendou reveals his true motive for inviting his son back to Tokyo-3: Shinji is the only child capable of efficiently piloting Evangelion Unit-01, a new robot that synchronizes with his biometrics. Despite the brutal psychological trauma brought about by piloting an Evangelion, Shinji defends Tokyo-3 against the angelic threat, oblivious to his father's dark machinations.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Director Hideaki Anno's depression is what led to the dark themes of Shinseiki Evangelion.

However, as she works alongside veteran Enforcer Shinya Kougami, she soon learns that the Sibyl System's judgments are not as perfect as her fellow Inspectors assume. With everything she has known turned on its head, Akane wrestles with the question of what justice truly is, and whether it can be upheld through the use of a system that may already be corrupt.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "An edited version of the series received a rebroadcast starting July 10, 2014. 22 episodes of the original series were combined into eleven 46-minute long episodes with some scenes being slightly extended.

Under the blind belief that Eren still secretly harbors good intentions, Mikasa and the others enter the fray in an attempt to save their friend's very soul.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season Part 2 adapts content from volumes 29-32 of the original manga.", "season": "winter", "year": 2022, "broadcast": {"day": "Mondays", "time": "00:05", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Mondays at 00:05 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Production I.G", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"}, {"mal_id": 53, "type": "anime", "name": "Dentsu", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/53/Dentsu"}, {"mal_id": 143, "type": "anime", "name": "Mainichi Broadcasting System", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"}, {"mal_id": 144, "type": "anime", "name": "Pony Canyon", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/144/Pony_Canyon"}, {"mal_id": 159, "type": "anime", "name": "Kodansha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"}, {"mal_id": 1557, "type": "anime", "name": "Pony Canyon Enterprises", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1557/Pony_Canyon_Enterprises"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 569, "type": "anime", "name": "MAPPA", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/569/MAPPA"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 41, "type": "anime", "name": "Suspense", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/41/Suspense"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 58, "type": "anime", "name": "Gore", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/58/Gore"}, {"mal_id": 38, "type": "anime", "name": "Military", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"}, {"mal_id": 76, "type": "anime", "name": "Survival", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/76/Survival"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]}, {"mal_id": 6746, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/6746/Durarara", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/71772.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/71772t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/71772l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/71772.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/71772t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/71772l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "q5qlX4lWst0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5qlX4lWst0", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/q5qlX4lWst0?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/q5qlX4lWst0/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/q5qlX4lWst0/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/q5qlX4lWst0/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/q5qlX4lWst0/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/q5qlX4lWst0/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Durarara!!"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Dhurarara!!"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Dyurarara!!"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Dulalala!!"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Dullalala!!"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "DRRR!!"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30c7\u30e5\u30e9\u30e9\u30e9!!"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Durarara!!"}], "title": "Durarara!!", "title_english": "Durarara!!", "title_japanese": "\u30c7\u30e5\u30e9\u30e9\u30e9!!", "title_synonyms": ["Dhurarara!!", "Dyurarara!!", "Dulalala!!", "Dullalala!!", "DRRR!!"], "type": "TV", "source": "Light novel", "episodes": 24, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2010-01-08T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2010-06-25T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 8, "month": 1, "year": 2010}, "to": {"day": 25, "month": 6, "year": 2010}}, "string": "Jan 8, 2010 to Jun 25, 2010"}, "duration": "24 min per ep", "rating": "R -

The only problem is, they end up destroying the entire shop as well as accidentally killing the local magistrate's son.\n\nFor their crime, the two samurai are captured and set to be executed.

Thus, Tooru had arrived to cash in on the offer, ready to repay her savior's kindness by working as her personal maidservant. Though deeply regretful of her words and hesitant to follow through on her promise, a mix of guilt and Tooru's incredible dragon abilities convinces Kobayashi to take the girl in.\n\nDespite being extremely efficient at her job, the maid's unorthodox methods of housekeeping often end up horrifying Kobayashi and at times bring more trouble than help. Furthermore, the circumstances behind the dragon's arrival on Earth seem to be much more complicated than at first glance, as Tooru bears some heavy emotions and painful memories. To top it all off, Tooru's presence ends up attracting several other mythical beings to her new home, bringing in a host of eccentric personalities. Although Kobayashi makes her best effort to handle the crazy situation that she has found herself in, nothing has prepared her for this new life with a dragon maid.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "winter", "year": 2017, "broadcast": {"day": "Thursdays", "time": "00:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Thursdays at 00:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 104, "type": "anime", "name": "Lantis", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/104/Lantis"}, {"mal_id": 144, "type": "anime", "name": "Pony Canyon", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/144/Pony_Canyon"}, {"mal_id": 1500, "type": "anime", "name": "ABC Animation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1500/ABC_Animation"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}, {"mal_id": 1468, "type": "anime", "name": "Crunchyroll", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1468/Crunchyroll"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Kyoto Animation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2/Kyoto_Animation"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 36, "type": "anime", "name": "Slice of Life", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life"}, {"mal_id": 37, "type": "anime", "name": "Supernatural", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 41587, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/41587/Boku_no_Hero_Academia_5th_Season", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1911/113611.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1911/113611t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1911/113611l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1911/113611.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1911/113611t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1911/113611l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "kkmW-tppFPM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkmW-tppFPM", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/kkmW-tppFPM?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/kkmW-tppFPM/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/kkmW-tppFPM/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/kkmW-tppFPM/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/kkmW-tppFPM/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/kkmW-tppFPM/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Boku no Hero Academia 5th Season"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "My Hero Academia 5"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u50d5\u306e\u30d2\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc\u30a2\u30ab\u30c7\u30df\u30a2"}, {"type": "English", "title": "My Hero Academia Season 5"}, {"type": "German", "title": "My Hero Academia Staffel 5"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "My Hero Academia Temporada 5"}, {"type": "French", "title": "My Hero Academia Saison 5"}], "title": "Boku no Hero Academia 5th Season", "title_english": "My Hero Academia Season 5", "title_japanese": "\u50d5\u306e\u30d2\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc\u30a2\u30ab\u30c7\u30df\u30a2", "title_synonyms": ["My Hero Academia 5"], "type": "TV", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 25, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2021-03-27T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2021-09-25T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 27, "month": 3, "year": 2021}, "to": {"day": 25, "month": 9, "year": 2021}}, "string": "Mar 27, 2021 to Sep 25, 2021"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.35, "scored_by": 669779, "rank": 2663, "popularity": 113, "members": 1294143, "favorites": 10234, "synopsis": "UA Academy's Class 1-A has been the focus of a substantial amount of public attention due to the multiple villain attacks they have faced over the past school year.

Despite their normal appearance, the new members of the SOS Brigade each carry their own secrets related to Haruhi. Caught up in the mystery surrounding the eccentric club leader, Kyon is whisked away on a series of misadventures by Haruhi and the SOS Brigade, each one bringing him closer to the truth about who and what she is.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu aired in a nonlinear order.

Moreover, when he enrolls at the academy to reclaim his rightful title, he finds out that demonkind remembers him differently.

Though they face an army of monsters beyond anything they could have previously imagined, Mikasa, Armin, and their allies stand brave in the face of certain doom.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season - Kanketsu-hen adapts content from volumes 32-34 of the original manga.", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Production I.G", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"}, {"mal_id": 53, "type": "anime", "name": "Dentsu", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/53/Dentsu"}, {"mal_id": 143, "type": "anime", "name": "Mainichi Broadcasting System", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"}, {"mal_id": 144, "type": "anime", "name": "Pony Canyon", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/144/Pony_Canyon"}, {"mal_id": 159, "type": "anime", "name": "Kodansha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"}, {"mal_id": 1499, "type": "anime", "name": "Techno Sound", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1499/Techno_Sound"}, {"mal_id": 1557, "type": "anime", "name": "Pony Canyon Enterprises", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1557/Pony_Canyon_Enterprises"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 569, "type": "anime", "name": "MAPPA", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/569/MAPPA"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 41, "type": "anime", "name": "Suspense", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/41/Suspense"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 58, "type": "anime", "name": "Gore", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/58/Gore"}, {"mal_id": 38, "type": "anime", "name": "Military", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"}, {"mal_id": 76, "type": "anime", "name": "Survival", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/76/Survival"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]}, {"mal_id": 39547, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/39547/Yahari_Ore_no_Seishun_Love_Comedy_wa_Machigatteiru_Kan", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1958/107912.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1958/107912t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1958/107912l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1958/107912.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1958/107912t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1958/107912l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "UsJUP98qr1M", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsJUP98qr1M", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/UsJUP98qr1M?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/UsJUP98qr1M/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/UsJUP98qr1M/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/UsJUP98qr1M/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/UsJUP98qr1M/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/UsJUP98qr1M/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru.

Shackled to Elsie via a deadly collar, Keima now has his title of \"God of Conquest\" put to the ultimate test as he is forced to navigate through the hearts of a multitude of real-life girls.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "fall", "year": 2010, "broadcast": {"day": "Thursdays", "time": "01:50", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Thursdays at 01:50 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 16, "type": "anime", "name": "TV Tokyo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"}, {"mal_id": 31, "type": "anime", "name": "Geneon Universal Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/31/Geneon_Universal_Entertainment"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 376, "type": "anime", "name": "Sentai Filmworks", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 32, "type": "anime", "name": "Manglobe", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/32/Manglobe"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}, {"mal_id": 37, "type": "anime", "name": "Supernatural", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 35, "type": "anime", "name": "Harem", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/35/Harem"}, {"mal_id": 69, "type": "anime", "name": "Otaku Culture", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/69/Otaku_Culture"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]}, {"mal_id": 58567, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/58567/Ore_dake_Level_Up_na_Ken_Season_2__Arise_from_the_Shadow", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1448/147351.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1448/147351t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1448/147351l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1448/147351.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1448/147351t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1448/147351l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "GDMXGzjJzS4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDMXGzjJzS4", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/GDMXGzjJzS4?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/GDMXGzjJzS4/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/GDMXGzjJzS4/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/GDMXGzjJzS4/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/GDMXGzjJzS4/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/GDMXGzjJzS4/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Ore dake Level Up na Ken Season 2: Arise from the Shadow"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Solo Leveling Second Season"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u4ffa\u3060\u3051\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u306a\u4ef6 Season 2 -Arise from the Shadow-"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Solo Leveling Season 2: Arise from the Shadow"}], "title": "Ore dake Level Up na Ken Season 2: Arise from the Shadow", "title_english": "Solo Leveling Season 2: Arise from the Shadow", "title_japanese": "\u4ffa\u3060\u3051\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u306a\u4ef6 Season 2 -Arise from the Shadow-", "title_synonyms": ["Solo Leveling Second Season"], "type": "TV", "source": "Web manga", "episodes": 13, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2025-01-05T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2025-03-30T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 5, "month": 1, "year": 2025}, "to": {"day": 30, "month": 3, "year": 2025}}, "string": "Jan 5, 2025 to Mar 30, 2025"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "R - 17+ (violence & profanity)", "score": 8.67, "scored_by": 400761, "rank": 76, "popularity": 363, "members": 650313, "favorites": 10414, "synopsis": "Sung Jin-Woo, dubbed the weakest hunter of all mankind, grows stronger by the day with the supernatural powers he has gained.

Thus the pair begins creating manga under the pen name Muto Ashirogi, hoping to become the greatest mangaka in Japan, the likes of which no one has ever seen.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Bakuman. was licensed by Media Blasters in North America, but only released one 2-disc DVD containing the first 7 episodes, the rest of the releases were cancelled.", "season": "fall", "year": 2010, "broadcast": {"day": "Saturdays", "time": "18:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Saturdays at 18:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 111, "type": "anime", "name": "NHK", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/111/NHK"}, {"mal_id": 1365, "type": "anime", "name": "Shueisha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1365/Shueisha"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 250, "type": "anime", "name": "Media Blasters", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/250/Media_Blasters"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 7, "type": "anime", "name": "J.C.Staff", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/7/JCStaff"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 69, "type": "anime", "name": "Otaku Culture", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/69/Otaku_Culture"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]}, {"mal_id": 11499, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/11499/Sankarea", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1487/95651.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1487/95651t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1487/95651l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1487/95651.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1487/95651t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1487/95651l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "oNO0-pn2_Xk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNO0-pn2_Xk", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/oNO0-pn2_Xk?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/oNO0-pn2_Xk/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/oNO0-pn2_Xk/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/oNO0-pn2_Xk/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/oNO0-pn2_Xk/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/oNO0-pn2_Xk/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Sankarea"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u3055\u3093\u304b\u308c\u3042"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Sankarea: Undying Love"}, {"type": "German", "title": "Sankarea: Undying Love"}], "title": "Sankarea", "title_english": "Sankarea: Undying Love", "title_japanese": "\u3055\u3093\u304b\u308c\u3042", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "TV", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2012-04-06T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2012-06-29T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 6, "month": 4, "year": 2012}, "to": {"day": 29, "month": 6, "year": 2012}}, "string": "Apr 6, 2012 to Jun 29, 2012"}, "duration": "24 min per ep", "rating": "R+ - Mild Nudity", "score": 7.27, "scored_by": 326938, "rank": 3071, "popularity": 367, "members": 645793, "favorites": 2832, "synopsis": "Ever since he was a child, zombie-obsessed Chihiro Furuya has wanted an undead girlfriend.

However, living a normal life is impossible, as he is established as a local celebrity almost as soon as he arrives.\n\nAs Shin Wolford adjusts to his high school life in the capital, he makes new friends, learns about the world, and fights off the various forces of evil surrounding him and his city.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 2019, "broadcast": {"day": "Wednesdays", "time": "23:30", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Wednesdays at 23:30 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 64, "type": "anime", "name": "Sotsu", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/64/Sotsu"}, {"mal_id": 1334, "type": "anime", "name": "Docomo Anime Store", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1334/Docomo_Anime_Store"}, {"mal_id": 1500, "type": "anime", "name": "ABC Animation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1500/ABC_Animation"}, {"mal_id": 1696, "type": "anime", "name": "Kadokawa", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 300, "type": "anime", "name": "SILVER LINK.", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/300/SILVER_LINK"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 62, "type": "anime", "name": "Isekai", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/62/Isekai"}, {"mal_id": 72, "type": "anime", "name": "Reincarnation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/72/Reincarnation"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 54112, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/54112/Zom_100__Zombie_ni_Naru_made_ni_Shitai_100_no_Koto", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1384/136408.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1384/136408t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1384/136408l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1384/136408.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1384/136408t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1384/136408l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "S1NzUyUD6Ks", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1NzUyUD6Ks", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/S1NzUyUD6Ks?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/S1NzUyUD6Ks/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/S1NzUyUD6Ks/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/S1NzUyUD6Ks/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/S1NzUyUD6Ks/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/S1NzUyUD6Ks/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Zom 100: Zombie ni Naru made ni Shitai 100 no Koto"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Bucket List of The Dead"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Zombie 100: 100 Things I Want to do Before I Become a Zombie"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30be\u30f3100\uff5e\u30be\u30f3\u30d3\u306b\u306a\u308b\u307e\u3067\u306b\u3057\u305f\u3044100\u306e\u3053\u3068\uff5e"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead"}], "title": "Zom 100: Zombie ni Naru made ni Shitai 100 no Koto", "title_english": "Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead", "title_japanese": "\u30be\u30f3100\uff5e\u30be\u30f3\u30d3\u306b\u306a\u308b\u307e\u3067\u306b\u3057\u305f\u3044100\u306e\u3053\u3068\uff5e", "title_synonyms": ["Bucket List of The Dead", "Zombie 100: 100 Things I Want to do Before I Become a Zombie"], "type": "TV", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2023-07-09T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2023-12-26T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 9, "month": 7, "year": 2023}, "to": {"day": 26, "month": 12, "year": 2023}}, "string": "Jul 9, 2023 to Dec 26, 2023"}, "duration": "24 min per ep", "rating": "R - 17+ (violence & profanity)", "score": 7.73, "scored_by": 305641, "rank": 1259, "popularity": 371, "members": 638698, "favorites": 4184, "synopsis": "After graduating from a top university with an impressive extracurricular record in the rugby club, Akira Tendou has nailed every step of the way to securing his dream job.

Regardless of her decision, the path she chooses is one that will affect the past, the present, and the future.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "The series won the 2013 Newtype Anime Awards for Best Anime Film.", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 61, "type": "anime", "name": "Frontier Works", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/61/Frontier_Works"}, {"mal_id": 108, "type": "anime", "name": "Media Factory", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/108/Media_Factory"}, {"mal_id": 166, "type": "anime", "name": "Movic", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"}, {"mal_id": 238, "type": "anime", "name": "AT-X", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"}, {"mal_id": 352, "type": "anime", "name": "Kadokawa Pictures Japan", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/352/Kadokawa_Pictures_Japan"}, {"mal_id": 963, "type": "anime", "name": "MAGES.", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/963/MAGES"}, {"mal_id": 2896, "type": "anime", "name": "Cinema Sunshine", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2896/Cinema_Sunshine"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 314, "type": "anime", "name": "White Fox", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/314/White_Fox"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 40750, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/40750/Kaifuku_Jutsushi_no_Yarinaoshi", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1301/110018.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1301/110018t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1301/110018l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1301/110018.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1301/110018t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1301/110018l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "dLwpj-sjnho", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLwpj-sjnho", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/dLwpj-sjnho?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/dLwpj-sjnho/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/dLwpj-sjnho/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/dLwpj-sjnho/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/dLwpj-sjnho/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/dLwpj-sjnho/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Kaifuku Jutsushi no Yarinaoshi"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Kaiyari"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u56de\u5fa9\u8853\u58eb\u306e\u3084\u308a\u76f4\u3057"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Redo of Healer"}, {"type": "German", "title": "Redo of Healer"}], "title": "Kaifuku Jutsushi no Yarinaoshi", "title_english": "Redo of Healer", "title_japanese": "\u56de\u5fa9\u8853\u58eb\u306e\u3084\u308a\u76f4\u3057", "title_synonyms": ["Kaiyari"], "type": "TV", "source": "Light novel", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2021-01-13T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2021-03-31T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 13, "month": 1, "year": 2021}, "to": {"day": 31, "month": 3, "year": 2021}}, "string": "Jan 13, 2021 to Mar 31, 2021"}, "duration": "24 min per ep", "rating": "R+ - Mild Nudity", "score": 6.32, "scored_by": 358333, "rank": null, "popularity": 383, "members": 625614, "favorites": 6506, "synopsis": "When Keyaru acquired his powers as a Hero who specialized in healing all injuries regardless of severity, it seemed that he would walk the path to a great future.

Langa is in desperate need of money. After they both visit \"S\" when tasked by Reki's boss, they get into trouble and are forced into a bet that requires Langa to skate in a race. However, the mysterious transfer student holds a trump card that Reki is unaware of, one which might help him win the race in the most unexpected way.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "winter", "year": 2021, "broadcast": {"day": "Sundays", "time": "02:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Sundays at 02:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 17, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"}, {"mal_id": 166, "type": "anime", "name": "Movic", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"}, {"mal_id": 1500, "type": "anime", "name": "ABC Animation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1500/ABC_Animation"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 493, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex of America", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/493/Aniplex_of_America"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Bones", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/4/Bones"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 30, "type": "anime", "name": "Sports", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/30/Sports"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 3, "type": "anime", "name": "Racing", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/3/Racing"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 15315, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/15315/Mondaiji-tachi_ga_Isekai_kara_Kuru_Sou_desu_yo", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/43369.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/43369t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/43369l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/43369.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/43369t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/43369l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "yDkUcijfoFc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDkUcijfoFc", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/yDkUcijfoFc?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/yDkUcijfoFc/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/yDkUcijfoFc/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/yDkUcijfoFc/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/yDkUcijfoFc/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/yDkUcijfoFc/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou desu yo?"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u554f\u984c\u5150\u305f\u3061\u304c\u7570\u4e16\u754c\u304b\u3089\u6765\u308b\u305d\u3046\u3067\u3059\u3088?"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Problem Children Are Coming from Another World, Aren't They?"}, {"type": "German", "title": "Problem Children Are Coming from Another World, Aren't They?"}, {"type": "French", "title": "Problem Children Are Coming from Another World, Aren't They?"}], "title": "Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou desu yo?", "title_english": "Problem Children Are Coming from Another World, Aren't They?", "title_japanese": "\u554f\u984c\u5150\u305f\u3061\u304c\u7570\u4e16\u754c\u304b\u3089\u6765\u308b\u305d\u3046\u3067\u3059\u3088?", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "TV", "source": "Light novel", "episodes": 10, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2013-01-12T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2013-03-16T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 12, "month": 1, "year": 2013}, "to": {"day": 16, "month": 3, "year": 2013}}, "string": "Jan 12, 2013 to Mar 16, 2013"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.41, "scored_by": 321214, "rank": 2395, "popularity": 395, "members": 608546, "favorites": 3735, "synopsis": "Izayoi Sakamaki, Asuka Kudou, and You Kasukabe are extraordinary teenagers who are blessed with psychic powers but completely fed up with their disproportionately mundane lives\u2014until, unexpectedly, each of them receives a strange envelope containing an invitation to a mysterious place known as Little Garden. \n\nInexplicably dropped into a vast new world, the trio is greeted by Kurousagi, who explains that they have been given a once-in-a-lifetime chance to participate in special high-stakes games using their abilities.

With Ainz's motivations beyond his comprehension, Jircniv can do nothing but watch as humanity's future changes before his very eyes.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Overlord IV was released on Blu-ray and DVD in Japan from October 26, 2022 to December 23, 2022.
