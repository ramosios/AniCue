Japan. Naming her in-game character Maple, she sets out on her journey. As a complete novice to such games, she allocates all of her stat points into vitality, desiring to not get hurt. With not a single point in any other stat, Maple has extraordinarily high defense, but she can't move quickly or hit hard.\n\nThis does not end badly for her, however. Due to her high defense, Maple acquires overpowered skills such as Total Defense, Poison Immunity, and Devour. These skills, along with the incredibly powerful items she obtains, allow her to obliterate most enemies in a single hit. After only a few days of playing the game, Maple claims third place in a server-wide event, gaining a reputation as a player who is both unkillable and absurdly powerful.\n\nDespite her overpowered character, Kaede has much to learn. As she progresses through the game, she meets new friends and acquaintances, helping her complete new levels and events. Through all of her adventures, she may even pick up some other crazy skills that exceed all expectations.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "winter", "year": 2020, "broadcast": {"day": "Wednesdays", "time": "22:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Wednesdays at 22:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 238, "type": "anime", "name": "AT-X", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"}, {"mal_id": 963, "type": "anime", "name": "MAGES.", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/963/MAGES"}, {"mal_id": 1334, "type": "anime", "name": "Docomo Anime Store", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1334/Docomo_Anime_Store"}, {"mal_id": 1345, "type": "anime", "name": "Sammy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1345/Sammy"}, {"mal_id": 1500, "type": "anime", "name": "ABC Animation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1500/ABC_Animation"}, {"mal_id": 1551, "type": "anime", "name": "Kadokawa Media House", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1551/Kadokawa_Media_House"}, {"mal_id": 1696, "type": "anime", "name": "Kadokawa", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"}, {"mal_id": 1819, "type": "anime", "name": "D-techno", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1819/D-techno"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 300, "type": "anime", "name": "SILVER LINK.", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/300/SILVER_LINK"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 79, "type": "anime", "name": "Video Game", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/79/Video_Game"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 31404, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/31404/Netoge_no_Yome_wa_Onnanoko_ja_Nai_to_Omotta", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/79414.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/79414t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/79414l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/79414.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/79414t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/79414l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "_iMzdyYRPrk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iMzdyYRPrk", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/_iMzdyYRPrk?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/_iMzdyYRPrk/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/_iMzdyYRPrk/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/_iMzdyYRPrk/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/_iMzdyYRPrk/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/_iMzdyYRPrk/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Netoge no Yome wa Onnanoko ja Nai to Omotta?"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Net Game no Yome wa Onna no Ko ja Nai to Omotta?"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "NetoYome"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30cd\u30c8\u30b2\u306e\u5ac1\u306f\u5973\u306e\u5b50\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044\u3068\u601d\u3063\u305f\uff1f"}, {"type": "English", "title": "And you thought there is never a girl online?"}, {"type": "German", "title": "And you thought there is never a girl online?"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "And You Thought There is Never a Girl Online?"}, {"type": "French", "title": "And You Thought There is Never a Girl Online?"}], "title": "Netoge no Yome wa Onnanoko ja Nai to Omotta?", "title_english": "And you thought there is never a girl online?", "title_japanese": "\u30cd\u30c8\u30b2\u306e\u5ac1\u306f\u5973\u306e\u5b50\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044\u3068\u601d\u3063\u305f\uff1f", "title_synonyms": ["Net Game no Yome wa Onna no Ko ja Nai to Omotta?", "NetoYome"], "type": "TV", "source": "Light novel", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2016-04-07T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2016-06-23T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 7, "month": 4, "year": 2016}, "to": {"day": 23, "month": 6, "year": 2016}}, "string": "Apr 7, 2016 to Jun 23, 2016"}, "duration": "24 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 -

However, deep inside him lies a desire to destroy the current structure that dominates British society and those who benefit from it. \n\nAlongside his brothers Albert and Louis, William will do anything it takes to change the filthy world he lives in\u2014even if blood must be spilled.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "fall", "year": 2020, "broadcast": {"day": "Sundays", "time": "23:53", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Sundays at 23:53 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 143, "type": "anime", "name": "Mainichi Broadcasting System", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"}, {"mal_id": 1365, "type": "anime", "name": "Shueisha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1365/Shueisha"}, {"mal_id": 1492, "type": "anime", "name": "Yomiuri TV Enterprise", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1492/Yomiuri_TV_Enterprise"}, {"mal_id": 1840, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai Namco Arts", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1840/Bandai_Namco_Arts"}, {"mal_id": 1992, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai Spirits", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1992/Bandai_Spirits"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Production I.G", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 7, "type": "anime", "name": "Mystery", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"}, {"mal_id": 41, "type": "anime", "name": "Suspense", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/41/Suspense"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 50, "type": "anime", "name": "Adult Cast", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"}, {"mal_id": 13, "type": "anime", "name": "Historical", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}, {"mal_id": 68, "type": "anime", "name": "Organized Crime", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/68/Organized_Crime"}, {"mal_id": 40, "type": "anime", "name": "Psychological", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]}, {"mal_id": 46102, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/46102/Odd_Taxi", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1981/113348.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1981/113348t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1981/113348l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1981/113348.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1981/113348t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1981/113348l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "rS228HesD9g", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rS228HesD9g", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/rS228HesD9g?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/rS228HesD9g/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/rS228HesD9g/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/rS228HesD9g/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/rS228HesD9g/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/rS228HesD9g/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Odd Taxi"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30aa\u30c3\u30c9\u30bf\u30af\u30b7\u30fc"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Odd Taxi"}], "title": "Odd Taxi", "title_english": "Odd Taxi", "title_japanese": "\u30aa\u30c3\u30c9\u30bf\u30af\u30b7\u30fc", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "TV", "source": "Original", "episodes": 13, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2021-04-06T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2021-06-29T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 6, "month": 4, "year": 2021}, "to": {"day": 29, "month": 6, "year": 2021}}, "string": "Apr 6, 2021 to Jun 29, 2021"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 8.64, "scored_by": 239356, "rank": 84, "popularity": 509, "members": 485970, "favorites": 8937, "synopsis": "Eccentric and blunt, the walrus Hiroshi Odokawa lives a relatively normal life.

Although the senior Shikada initially refuses, he states that he will change his mind on one condition: if Hotaru can convince Kokonotsu to take over the family shop. And so begins Hotaru's mission to enlighten the boy on the true joy of delicious and nostalgic dagashi!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "winter", "year": 2016, "broadcast": {"day": "Fridays", "time": "02:16", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Fridays at 02:16 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 144, "type": "anime", "name": "Pony Canyon", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/144/Pony_Canyon"}, {"mal_id": 145, "type": "anime", "name": "TBS", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/145/TBS"}, {"mal_id": 315, "type": "anime", "name": "DAX Production", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/315/DAX_Production"}, {"mal_id": 693, "type": "anime", "name": "BS-TBS", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/693/BS-TBS"}, {"mal_id": 1430, "type": "anime", "name": "Shogakukan", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1430/Shogakukan"}, {"mal_id": 1496, "type": "anime", "name": "Lawson", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1496/Lawson"}, {"mal_id": 1581, "type": "anime", "name": "RAY", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1581/RAY"}, {"mal_id": 1583, "type": "anime", "name": "U-NEXT", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1583/U-NEXT"}, {"mal_id": 1585, "type": "anime", "name": "Nichion", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1585/Nichion"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 91, "type": "anime", "name": "feel.", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/91/feel"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 47, "type": "anime", "name": "Gourmet", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/47/Gourmet"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]}, {"mal_id": 40935, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/40935/Beastars_2nd_Season", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1097/109646.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1097/109646t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1097/109646l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1097/109646.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1097/109646t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1097/109646l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "8t0ctEki7Dg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t0ctEki7Dg", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/8t0ctEki7Dg?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/8t0ctEki7Dg/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/8t0ctEki7Dg/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/8t0ctEki7Dg/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/8t0ctEki7Dg/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/8t0ctEki7Dg/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Beastars 2nd Season"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "BEASTARS 2\u671f"}], "title": "Beastars 2nd Season", "title_english": null, "title_japanese": "BEASTARS 2\u671f", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "TV", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2021-01-07T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2021-03-25T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 7, "month": 1, "year": 2021}, "to": {"day": 25, "month": 3, "year": 2021}}, "string": "Jan 7, 2021 to Mar 25, 2021"}, "duration": "22 min per ep", "rating": "R - 17+ (violence & profanity)", "score": 7.76, "scored_by": 252092, "rank": 1161, "popularity": 516, "members": 479831, "favorites": 2293, "synopsis": "\"Beastar\"\u2014a title awarded to beasts who prove their excellence through fighting inequality to unite carnivores and herbivores in an anthropomorphic animal society.

But she may have a reason to worry after all: she finds that her left hand has reverted back to its human form.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Hanamonogatari adapts the third volume of NisiOisiN's Monogatari Series: Second Season.", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 17, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"}, {"mal_id": 159, "type": "anime", "name": "Kodansha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 493, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex of America", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/493/Aniplex_of_America"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 44, "type": "anime", "name": "Shaft", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/44/Shaft"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 7, "type": "anime", "name": "Mystery", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"}, {"mal_id": 37, "type": "anime", "name": "Supernatural", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 25159, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/25159/Inou-Battle_wa_Nichijou-kei_no_Naka_de", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/67047.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/67047t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/67047l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/67047.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/67047t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/67047l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "fIEeVqJjjIQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIEeVqJjjIQ", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/fIEeVqJjjIQ?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/fIEeVqJjjIQ/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/fIEeVqJjjIQ/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/fIEeVqJjjIQ/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/fIEeVqJjjIQ/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/fIEeVqJjjIQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "InoBato"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Inou-Battle in the Usually Daze."}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Inou Battle Within Everyday Life"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u7570\u80fd\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u306f\u65e5\u5e38\u7cfb\u306e\u306a\u304b\u3067"}, {"type": "English", "title": "When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace"}, {"type": "German", "title": "When Supernatural Battle Became Commonplace"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "When Supernatural Battle Became Commonplace: Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de"}], "title": "Inou-Battle wa Nichijou-kei no Naka de", "title_english": "When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace", "title_japanese": "\u7570\u80fd\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u306f\u65e5\u5e38\u7cfb\u306e\u306a\u304b\u3067", "title_synonyms": ["InoBato", "Inou-Battle in the Usually Daze.", "Inou Battle Within Everyday Life"], "type": "TV", "source": "Light novel", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2014-10-07T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2014-12-23T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 7, "month": 10, "year": 2014}, "to": {"day": 23, "month": 12, "year": 2014}}, "string": "Oct 7, 2014 to Dec 23, 2014"}, "duration": "24 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.04, "scored_by": 205043, "rank": 4310, "popularity": 564, "members": 446108, "favorites": 961, "synopsis": "During a Literature Club meeting, the four club members\u2014along with their faculty adviser's niece\u2014suddenly find themselves with supernatural powers.

With no parents, no real family, and no place to go, Ren escapes into the confusing streets and alleyways of Shibuya. Through the twists and turns of the alleys, Ren stumbles into the intimidating Kumatetsu, who leads him to the beast realm of Shibuten.\n\nFor Kumatetsu, the boy represents a chance for him to become a candidate to replace the lord of the realm once he retires. While nearly unmatched in combat, Kumatetsu's chilly persona leaves him with no disciples to teach and no way to prove he is worthy of becoming the lord's successor. \n\nWhile the two share different goals, they agree to help each other in order to reach them. Kumatetsu searches for recognition; Ren, now known as Kyuuta, searches for the home he never had. As the years pass by, it starts to become apparent that the two are helping each other in more ways than they had originally thought. Perhaps there has always been less of a difference between them, a boy and a beast, than either of the two ever realized.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "With over \u00a55.8 billion in total, Bakemono no Ko was Japan's second highest-grossing domestic film of 2015.

Willem awakens 500 years later, only to find himself the sole survivor of his race as mankind is wiped out.\n \nTogether with the other surviving races, Willem takes refuge on the floating islands in the sky, living in fear of the Beasts below. He lives a life of loneliness and only does odd jobs to get by. One day, he is tasked with being a weapon storehouse caretaker. Thinking nothing of it, Willem accepts, but he soon realizes that these weapons are actually a group of young Leprechauns. Though they bear every resemblance to humans, they have no regard for their own lives, identifying themselves as mere weapons of war. Among them is Chtholly Nota Seniorious, who is more than willing to sacrifice herself if it means defeating the Beasts and ensuring peace.\n \nWillem becomes something of a father figure for the young Leprechauns, watching over them fondly and supporting them in any way he can. He, who once fought so bravely on the frontlines, can now only hope that the ones being sent to battle return safely from the monsters that destroyed his kind.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 2017, "broadcast": {"day": "Tuesdays", "time": "23:30", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Tuesdays at 23:30 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 104, "type": "anime", "name": "Lantis", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/104/Lantis"}, {"mal_id": 238, "type": "anime", "name": "AT-X", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"}, {"mal_id": 315, "type": "anime", "name": "DAX Production", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/315/DAX_Production"}, {"mal_id": 460, "type": "anime", "name": "KlockWorx", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/460/KlockWorx"}, {"mal_id": 1551, "type": "anime", "name": "Kadokawa Media House", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1551/Kadokawa_Media_House"}, {"mal_id": 1651, "type": "anime", "name": "Production Ace", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1651/Production_Ace"}, {"mal_id": 1696, "type": "anime", "name": "Kadokawa", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 41, "type": "anime", "name": "Satelight", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/41/Satelight"}, {"mal_id": 605, "type": "anime", "name": "C2C", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/605/C2C"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 8795, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/8795/Panty___Stocking_with_Garterbelt", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1296/142674.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1296/142674t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1296/142674l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1296/142674.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1296/142674t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1296/142674l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "iZbGlVqKXTM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZbGlVqKXTM", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/iZbGlVqKXTM?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/iZbGlVqKXTM/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/iZbGlVqKXTM/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/iZbGlVqKXTM/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/iZbGlVqKXTM/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/iZbGlVqKXTM/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "PanSto"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "PSG"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30d1\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\uff06\u30b9\u30c8\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0with\u30ac\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30d9\u30eb\u30c8"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt"}], "title": "Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt", "title_english": "Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt", "title_japanese": "\u30d1\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\uff06\u30b9\u30c8\u30c3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0with\u30ac\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u30d9\u30eb\u30c8", "title_synonyms": ["PanSto", "PSG"], "type": "TV", "source": "Original", "episodes": 13, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2010-10-02T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2010-12-25T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 2, "month": 10, "year": 2010}, "to": {"day": 25, "month": 12, "year": 2010}}, "string": "Oct 2, 2010 to Dec 25, 2010"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "R - 17+ (violence & profanity)", "score": 7.74, "scored_by": 210999, "rank": 1229, "popularity": 592, "members": 427851, "favorites": 6486, "synopsis": "The \"Anarchy Sisters,\" Panty and Stocking, have been kicked out of Heaven for, to put it mildly, misbehaving.

Stunned by such a comprehensive loss, Peco finds himself questioning why he plays to begin with. Seeing his potential as a player, Katase's coach begins to train Smile to overcome his hesitation, but he is reluctant to play if it is not for enjoyment.\n\nAs the two struggle to find meaning in the sport, a plethora of stronger players\u2014each with their own internal strifes\u2014await them at the inter-high tournament, where only the very best can persevere.

Tormented by unexplainable visions and her world unraveling around her, we travel with Saya through her struggle to find a way to the truth in a village where nothing is as it seems.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "summer", "year": 2011, "broadcast": {"day": "Fridays", "time": "01:40", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Fridays at 01:40 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 17, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"}, {"mal_id": 143, "type": "anime", "name": "Mainichi Broadcasting System", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"}, {"mal_id": 715, "type": "anime", "name": "Dwango", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/715/Dwango"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Production I.G", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 14, "type": "anime", "name": "Horror", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/14/Horror"}, {"mal_id": 7, "type": "anime", "name": "Mystery", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"}, {"mal_id": 37, "type": "anime", "name": "Supernatural", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 58, "type": "anime", "name": "Gore", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/58/Gore"}, {"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}, {"mal_id": 32, "type": "anime", "name": "Vampire", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/32/Vampire"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 27833, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/27833/Durararax2_Ketsu", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/77838.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/77838t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/77838l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/77838.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/77838t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/77838l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "S6WCHOxTfBM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6WCHOxTfBM", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/S6WCHOxTfBM?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/S6WCHOxTfBM/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/S6WCHOxTfBM/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/S6WCHOxTfBM/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/S6WCHOxTfBM/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/S6WCHOxTfBM/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Durarara!!x2 Ketsu"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Durarara!!x2 Ketsu"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30c7\u30e5\u30e9\u30e9\u30e9!!\u00d72 \u7d50"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Durarara!! x2 Ketsu"}], "title": "Durarara!!x2 Ketsu", "title_english": "Durarara!! x2 Ketsu", "title_japanese": "\u30c7\u30e5\u30e9\u30e9\u30e9!!\u00d72 \u7d50", "title_synonyms": ["Durarara!!x2 Ketsu"], "type": "TV", "source": "Light novel", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2016-01-09T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2016-03-26T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 9, "month": 1, "year": 2016}, "to": {"day": 26, "month": 3, "year": 2016}}, "string": "Jan 9, 2016 to Mar 26, 2016"}, "duration": "24 min per ep", "rating": "R - 17+ (violence & profanity)", "score": 8.05, "scored_by": 193913, "rank": 622, "popularity": 655, "members": 396092, "favorites": 1087, "synopsis": "As Mikado Ryuugamine continues to purge the Dollars from within in accordance with his warped sense of justice, Masaomi Kida hopes to bring his friend back to his senses by bringing the Yellow Scarves together once more.

Claiming that she will die if he doesn't kiss someone within 24 hours, Guri's pleas of desperation are misunderstood as pleas for love, leading Seiji to kiss the cute stranger that came barging into his house. In actuality, it turns out that this cosplaying cupid is the wielder of a Kiss Note, in which any pairing of names she writes will kiss and become a couple. Guri explains that she misspelt and accidentally wrote Seiji's name while indulging in her yaoi fantasies, but because she had yet to pair him with anyone, their kiss was meaningless. Even worse, Guri reveals that if Seiji is not coupled with anyone soon, not only will she die, but Seiji will remain a virgin for eternity!\n\nEager to escape his fate, Seiji sets his sights on the beautiful and popular Akane Hiyama. But after Akane hears that he kissed Guri, she reveals the obsessive and psychopathic feelings that she holds for the unfortunate boy and proceeds to viciously attack them. In the ensuing confusion, Guri is able to pair Seiji with Akane in the Kiss Note, temporarily saving Seiji from any further bodily harm. But to complicate matters, Guri's newfound feelings lead her to also pair the two of them with herself. Just when the situation could not get any more convoluted, this new coupling with Guri has turned Seiji and Akane into temporary angels, forcing them into assisting the cupid with her work of pairing humans, lest they be cast into hell. With all semblance of normality snatched from his life, Seiji gets to work at matchmaking with these eccentric girls by his side.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 2017, "broadcast": {"day": "Fridays", "time": "02:35", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Fridays at 02:35 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 16, "type": "anime", "name": "TV Tokyo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"}, {"mal_id": 64, "type": "anime", "name": "Sotsu", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/64/Sotsu"}, {"mal_id": 213, "type": "anime", "name": "Half H.P Studio", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/213/Half_HP_Studio"}, {"mal_id": 460, "type": "anime", "name": "KlockWorx", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/460/KlockWorx"}, {"mal_id": 1039, "type": "anime", "name": "DIVE II Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1039/DIVE_II_Entertainment"}, {"mal_id": 1284, "type": "anime", "name": "Avex Pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1284/Avex_Pictures"}, {"mal_id": 1414, "type": "anime", "name": "bilibili", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1414/bilibili"}, {"mal_id": 1468, "type": "anime", "name": "Crunchyroll", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1468/Crunchyroll"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 1264, "type": "anime", "name": "EMT Squared", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1264/EMT_Squared"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}, {"mal_id": 37, "type": "anime", "name": "Supernatural", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 35, "type": "anime", "name": "Harem", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/35/Harem"}, {"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 33050, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/33050/Fate_stay_night_Movie__Heavens_Feel_-_III_Spring_Song", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1142/112957.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1142/112957t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1142/112957l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1142/112957.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1142/112957t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1142/112957l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "zfjbLLxdZOU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfjbLLxdZOU", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/zfjbLLxdZOU?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/zfjbLLxdZOU/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/zfjbLLxdZOU/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/zfjbLLxdZOU/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/zfjbLLxdZOU/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/zfjbLLxdZOU/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Fate/stay night Movie: Heaven's Feel - III.

Like most of Miyazaki's films, it was the top-grossing movie of its release year, earning $113 million in the domestic box office in 2013. The film was controversial on both sides of the political spectrum because of its sympathetic portrayal of Horikoshi and its perceived anti-war stance. The film was nominated for an Academy Award, Miyazaki's third nomination. The film has won several awards. In 2013 it won the Best Animated Feature during the Alliance of Women Film Journalists, during the New York Film Critics Online, during the Online Film Critics Society, during the San Francisco Film Critics Circle and during the Toronto Film Critics Association. Also in 2013 it won the Best Animated Film during the Boston Online Film Critics Association (which tied with Frozen), during the Boston Society of Film Critics, during the Chicago Film Critics Association, during the New York Film Critics Circle and during the San Diego Film Critics Society. During the same year it won the Audience Favorite \u2013 Animation during the Mill Valley Film Festival and the Best Family Film during the Women Film Critics Circle. In 2014 it won the Animation of the Year during the Japan Academy Prize, the Best Animated Film during the National Board of Review and the Best Motion Picture, Animated or Mixed Media during the Satellite Awards.", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 1585, "type": "anime", "name": "Nichion", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1585/Nichion"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 417, "type": "anime", "name": "Disney Platform Distribution", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/417/Disney_Platform_Distribution"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 21, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio Ghibli", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/21/Studio_Ghibli"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 46, "type": "anime", "name": "Award Winning", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/46/Award_Winning"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 13, "type": "anime", "name": "Historical", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 51958, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/51958/Kono_Subarashii_Sekai_ni_Bakuen_wo", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1626/135844.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1626/135844t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1626/135844l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1626/135844.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1626/135844t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1626/135844l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "IN5XdlB0x0U", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IN5XdlB0x0U", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/IN5XdlB0x0U?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/IN5XdlB0x0U/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/IN5XdlB0x0U/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/IN5XdlB0x0U/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/IN5XdlB0x0U/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/IN5XdlB0x0U/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Bakuen wo!"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u3053\u306e\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u3044\u4e16\u754c\u306b\u7206\u7114\u3092\uff01"}, {"type": "English", "title": "KonoSuba: An Explosion on This Wonderful World!"}], "title": "Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Bakuen wo!", "title_english": "KonoSuba: An Explosion on This Wonderful World!", "title_japanese": "\u3053\u306e\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u3044\u4e16\u754c\u306b\u7206\u7114\u3092\uff01", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "TV", "source": "Light novel", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2023-04-06T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2023-06-22T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 6, "month": 4, "year": 2023}, "to": {"day": 22, "month": 6, "year": 2023}}, "string": "Apr 6, 2023 to Jun 22, 2023"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.51, "scored_by": 157023, "rank": 1975, "popularity": 701, "members": 371001, "favorites": 1985, "synopsis": "Megumin is a young and passionate wizard from the Crimson Demon Village, a remote community of mages with red eyes and a flair for the dramatic.

There, he meets classmate Eiko Kawasegawa, the woman who had hired him as an intern in the present, alongside his new housemates and future Platinum Generation members: underachieving artist Aki Shino, aspiring singer and actress Nanako Kogure, and naturally-gifted writer Tsurayuki Rokuonji.\n\nWith each project they complete together, Kyouya and his friends venture closer to discovering their true potential as creators and remaking their lives into the ideal versions they desire.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "summer", "year": 2021, "broadcast": {"day": "Saturdays", "time": "21:30", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Saturdays at 21:30 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 719, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio Mausu", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/719/Studio_Mausu"}, {"mal_id": 1414, "type": "anime", "name": "bilibili", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1414/bilibili"}, {"mal_id": 1634, "type": "anime", "name": "Bushiroad Music", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1634/Bushiroad_Music"}, {"mal_id": 1671, "type": "anime", "name": "DMM pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1671/DMM_pictures"}, {"mal_id": 2202, "type": "anime", "name": "Front Wing", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2202/Front_Wing"}, {"mal_id": 2228, "type": "anime", "name": "Bushiroad Move", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2228/Bushiroad_Move"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 91, "type": "anime", "name": "feel.", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/91/feel"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 50, "type": "anime", "name": "Adult Cast", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"}, {"mal_id": 78, "type": "anime", "name": "Time Travel", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/78/Time_Travel"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 37786, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/37786/Yagate_Kimi_ni_Naru", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1783/96153.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1783/96153t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1783/96153l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1783/96153.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1783/96153t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1783/96153l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "9Tua7jvQgUs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Tua7jvQgUs", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Tua7jvQgUs?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/9Tua7jvQgUs/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/9Tua7jvQgUs/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/9Tua7jvQgUs/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/9Tua7jvQgUs/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/9Tua7jvQgUs/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Yagate Kimi ni Naru"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "YagaKimi"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Eventually"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "I Will Become You"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u3084\u304c\u3066\u541b\u306b\u306a\u308b"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Bloom Into You"}, {"type": "German", "title": "Bloom Into You"}, {"type": "French", "title": "Bloom Into You"}], "title": "Yagate Kimi ni Naru", "title_english": "Bloom Into You", "title_japanese": "\u3084\u304c\u3066\u541b\u306b\u306a\u308b", "title_synonyms": ["YagaKimi", "Eventually", "I Will Become You"], "type": "TV", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 13, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2018-10-05T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2018-12-28T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 5, "month": 10, "year": 2018}, "to": {"day": 28, "month": 12, "year": 2018}}, "string": "Oct 5, 2018 to Dec 28, 2018"}, "duration": "24 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.88, "scored_by": 155396, "rank": 900, "popularity": 704, "members": 370546, "favorites": 6832, "synopsis": "Yuu Koito has always been entranced with romantic shoujo manga and the lyrics of love songs.

When the involvement of the RIS extends beyond the scope of justice, the extent of the government's corruption\u2014as well as the trustworthiness of close allies\u2014are thrown into question. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 1977, "type": "anime", "name": "Netflix", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1977/Netflix"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 3051, "type": "anime", "name": "Anime Limited", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/3051/Anime_Limited"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Production I.G", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 7, "type": "anime", "name": "Mystery", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"}, {"mal_id": 41, "type": "anime", "name": "Suspense", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/41/Suspense"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 39, "type": "anime", "name": "Detective", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/39/Detective"}, {"mal_id": 40, "type": "anime", "name": "Psychological", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"}, {"mal_id": 31, "type": "anime", "name": "Super Power", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/31/Super_Power"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 52830, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/52830/Isekai_de_Cheat_Skill_wo_Te_ni_Shita_Ore_wa_Genjitsu_Sekai_wo_mo_Musou_Suru__Level_Up_wa_Jinsei_wo_Kaeta", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1316/134327.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1316/134327t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1316/134327l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1316/134327.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1316/134327t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1316/134327l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "u7YOzGniO5g", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7YOzGniO5g", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/u7YOzGniO5g?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/u7YOzGniO5g/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/u7YOzGniO5g/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/u7YOzGniO5g/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/u7YOzGniO5g/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/u7YOzGniO5g/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Isekai de Cheat Skill wo Te ni Shita Ore wa, Genjitsu Sekai wo mo Musou Suru: Level Up wa Jinsei wo Kaeta"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Iseleve"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u7570\u4e16\u754c\u3067\u30c1\u30fc\u30c8\u80fd\u529b\u3092\u624b\u306b\u3057\u305f\u4ffa\u306f\u3001\u73fe\u5b9f\u4e16\u754c\u3092\u3082\u7121\u53cc\u3059\u308b \uff5e\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u306f\u4eba\u751f\u3092\u5909\u3048\u305f\uff5e"}, {"type": "English", "title": "I Got a Cheat Skill in Another World and Became Unrivaled in The Real World, Too"}], "title": "Isekai de Cheat Skill wo Te ni Shita Ore wa, Genjitsu Sekai wo mo Musou Suru: Level Up wa Jinsei wo Kaeta", "title_english": "I Got a Cheat Skill in Another World and Became Unrivaled in The Real World, Too", "title_japanese": "\u7570\u4e16\u754c\u3067\u30c1\u30fc\u30c8\u80fd\u529b\u3092\u624b\u306b\u3057\u305f\u4ffa\u306f\u3001\u73fe\u5b9f\u4e16\u754c\u3092\u3082\u7121\u53cc\u3059\u308b \uff5e\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u306f\u4eba\u751f\u3092\u5909\u3048\u305f\uff5e", "title_synonyms": ["Iseleve"], "type": "TV", "source": "Light novel", "episodes": 13, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2023-04-07T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2023-06-30T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 7, "month": 4, "year": 2023}, "to": {"day": 30, "month": 6, "year": 2023}}, "string": "Apr 7, 2023 to Jun 30, 2023"}, "duration": "24 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 6.34, "scored_by": 192247, "rank": 8180, "popularity": 724, "members": 361544, "favorites": 2287, "synopsis": "All his life, Yuuya Tenjou has been the subject of resentment and contempt from everyone around him, even from his parents.

The pair are stark opposites, with Asakusa's childlike wonder contrasted by Kanamori's calculated approach to life. \n\nAfter a chance encounter where the two \"save\" the young model Tsubame Misuzaki from her overprotective bodyguard, a connection instantly sparks between Asakusa and Misuzaki, as both share an intense passion for art and animation. Whereas Asakusa is interested in backgrounds and settings, Misuzaki loves drawing the human form. Sensing a money-making opportunity, Kanamori suggests that they start an animation club, which they disguise as a motion picture club since the school already has an anime club. Thus begins the trio's journey of producing animation that will awe the world. \n\nFrom the brilliant mind of Masaaki Yuasa, Eizouken ni wa Te wo Dasu na! is a love letter to animation, wildly creative in its approach, and a testament to the potential of the medium.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Winner of the Grand Prize at the 24th Japan Media Arts Festival.", "season": "winter", "year": 2020, "broadcast": {"day": "Mondays", "time": "00:10", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Mondays at 00:10 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 415, "type": "anime", "name": "Warner Bros.

From three square meals a day to sports festivals, prison life in Nanba isn't actually that bad\u2014and it is the closest these four have to a home.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "fall", "year": 2016, "broadcast": {"day": "Wednesdays", "time": "03:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Wednesdays at 03:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 139, "type": "anime", "name": "Nihon Ad Systems", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/139/Nihon_Ad_Systems"}, {"mal_id": 315, "type": "anime", "name": "DAX Production", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/315/DAX_Production"}, {"mal_id": 737, "type": "anime", "name": "Sony Music Communications", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/737/Sony_Music_Communications"}, {"mal_id": 1468, "type": "anime", "name": "Crunchyroll", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1468/Crunchyroll"}, {"mal_id": 1481, "type": "anime", "name": "comico", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1481/comico"}, {"mal_id": 1493, "type": "anime", "name": "Tokuma Japan Communications", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1493/Tokuma_Japan_Communications"}, {"mal_id": 1555, "type": "anime", "name": "Nelke Planning", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1555/Nelke_Planning"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 41, "type": "anime", "name": "Satelight", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/41/Satelight"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 38993, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/38993/Karakai_Jouzu_no_Takagi-san_2", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1393/107033.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1393/107033t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1393/107033l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1393/107033.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1393/107033t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1393/107033l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "Z_iXQH8Bxog", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_iXQH8Bxog", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z_iXQH8Bxog?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/Z_iXQH8Bxog/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/Z_iXQH8Bxog/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/Z_iXQH8Bxog/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/Z_iXQH8Bxog/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/Z_iXQH8Bxog/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san 2"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Skilled Teaser Takagi-san 2nd Season"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san Second Season"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u304b\u3089\u304b\u3044\u4e0a\u624b\u306e\u9ad8\u6728\u3055\u30932"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Teasing Master Takagi-san 2"}, {"type": "German", "title": "Karakai Jozu No Takagi-san Staffel 2"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "Takagi-san: Experta en Bromas Pesadas Temporada 2"}, {"type": "French", "title": "Karakai Jozu No Takagi-san Saison 2"}], "title": "Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san 2", "title_english": "Teasing Master Takagi-san 2", "title_japanese": "\u304b\u3089\u304b\u3044\u4e0a\u624b\u306e\u9ad8\u6728\u3055\u30932", "title_synonyms": ["Skilled Teaser Takagi-san 2nd Season", "Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san Second Season"], "type": "TV", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2019-07-07T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2019-09-22T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 7, "month": 7, "year": 2019}, "to": {"day": 22, "month": 9, "year": 2019}}, "string": "Jul 7, 2019 to Sep 22, 2019"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 8.02, "scored_by": 192433, "rank": 653, "popularity": 745, "members": 353265, "favorites": 2311, "synopsis": "Even after spending a considerable amount of time with Takagi, Nishikata is still struggling to find a perfect plan to defeat the expert teaser.

However, there is a saying: \"there are no secrets that time cannot reveal.\" In time, Hime must learn the reality behind the things she took for granted as she grew up.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 2020, "broadcast": {"day": "Thursdays", "time": "23:30", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Thursdays at 23:30 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 53, "type": "anime", "name": "Dentsu", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/53/Dentsu"}, {"mal_id": 82, "type": "anime", "name": "Marvelous Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/82/Marvelous_Entertainment"}, {"mal_id": 159, "type": "anime", "name": "Kodansha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"}, {"mal_id": 238, "type": "anime", "name": "AT-X", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"}, {"mal_id": 719, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio Mausu", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/719/Studio_Mausu"}, {"mal_id": 1211, "type": "anime", "name": "Tokyo MX", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1211/Tokyo_MX"}, {"mal_id": 1284, "type": "anime", "name": "Avex Pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1284/Avex_Pictures"}, {"mal_id": 1635, "type": "anime", "name": "A-Sketch", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1635/A-Sketch"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 30, "type": "anime", "name": "Ajia-do", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/30/Ajia-do"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 53, "type": "anime", "name": "Childcare", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/53/Childcare"}, {"mal_id": 57, "type": "anime", "name": "Gag Humor", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/57/Gag_Humor"}, {"mal_id": 69, "type": "anime", "name": "Otaku Culture", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/69/Otaku_Culture"}, {"mal_id": 48, "type": "anime", "name": "Workplace", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/48/Workplace"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]}, {"mal_id": 202, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/202/Wolfs_Rain", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/59403.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/59403t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/59403l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/59403.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/59403t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/59403l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "6ydbrdQXMeM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ydbrdQXMeM", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/6ydbrdQXMeM?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/6ydbrdQXMeM/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/6ydbrdQXMeM/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/6ydbrdQXMeM/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/6ydbrdQXMeM/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/6ydbrdQXMeM/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Wolf's Rain"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Wolf Rain"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30a6\u30eb\u30d5\u30ba\u30ec\u30a4\u30f3"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Wolf's Rain"}], "title": "Wolf's Rain", "title_english": "Wolf's Rain", "title_japanese": "\u30a6\u30eb\u30d5\u30ba\u30ec\u30a4\u30f3", "title_synonyms": ["Wolf Rain"], "type": "TV", "source": "Original", "episodes": 26, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2003-01-07T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2003-07-29T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 7, "month": 1, "year": 2003}, "to": {"day": 29, "month": 7, "year": 2003}}, "string": "Jan 7, 2003 to Jul 29, 2003"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.79, "scored_by": 136801, "rank": 1101, "popularity": 759, "members": 345706, "favorites": 5869, "synopsis": "In a dying world, there exists an ancient legend: when the world ends, the gateway to paradise will be opened.

Coincidentally, the Ice Calamity Witch herself, Aliceliese \"Alice\" Lou Nebulis XI, also wishes for peace and is willing to do everything she can to bring down the Empire.\n\nAs Iska and Alice both yearn for a crusade that will turn the world into one without struggle, woe, or pain, the strings of fate tie them ever closer together, creating a bond that goes beyond something fabricated by mere coincidence.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "fall", "year": 2020, "broadcast": {"day": "Wednesdays", "time": "23:30", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Wednesdays at 23:30 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 144, "type": "anime", "name": "Pony Canyon", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/144/Pony_Canyon"}, {"mal_id": 238, "type": "anime", "name": "AT-X", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"}, {"mal_id": 1500, "type": "anime", "name": "ABC Animation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1500/ABC_Animation"}, {"mal_id": 1551, "type": "anime", "name": "Kadokawa Media House", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1551/Kadokawa_Media_House"}, {"mal_id": 1696, "type": "anime", "name": "Kadokawa", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"}, {"mal_id": 2074, "type": "anime", "name": "Bit grooove promotion", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2074/Bit_grooove_promotion"}, {"mal_id": 2290, "type": "anime", "name": "A3", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2290/A3"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 300, "type": "anime", "name": "SILVER LINK.", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/300/SILVER_LINK"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 38, "type": "anime", "name": "Military", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 32828, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/32828/Amaama_to_Inazuma", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/80546.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/80546t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/80546l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/80546.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/80546t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/80546l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "dyDTqDFprlY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyDTqDFprlY", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/dyDTqDFprlY?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/dyDTqDFprlY/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/dyDTqDFprlY/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/dyDTqDFprlY/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/dyDTqDFprlY/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/dyDTqDFprlY/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Amaama to Inazuma"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u7518\u3005\u3068\u7a32\u59bb"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Sweetness & Lightning"}, {"type": "German", "title": "Sweetness & Lightning"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "Sweetness & Lightning (Amaama to Inazuma)"}, {"type": "French", "title": "Sweetness & Lightning"}], "title": "Amaama to Inazuma", "title_english": "Sweetness & Lightning", "title_japanese": "\u7518\u3005\u3068\u7a32\u59bb", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "TV", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2016-07-05T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2016-09-20T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 5, "month": 7, "year": 2016}, "to": {"day": 20, "month": 9, "year": 2016}}, "string": "Jul 5, 2016 to Sep 20, 2016"}, "duration": "24 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.53, "scored_by": 145324, "rank": 1918, "popularity": 790, "members": 335993, "favorites": 1282, "synopsis": "Since the death of his wife, Kouhei Inuzuka has been caring for his young daughter Tsumugi to the best of his abilities.
