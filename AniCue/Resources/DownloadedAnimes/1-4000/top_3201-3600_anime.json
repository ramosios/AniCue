Having lost her mother at a young age, the only thing Akari has left of her is a deck of tarot cards and a dream to follow in her footsteps as a fortune teller.\n\nOne night, Akari has a dream of being attacked by a plant monster and witnesses a stronger version of herself defeat it. When she awakens, she discovers to her horror that the monster was actually Fuyuna. But mysteriously, Akari and her relatives soon forget Fuyuna ever existed. After another close encounter with a similar monster, she is rescued by three magical girls: Ginka Shirokane, Seira Hoshikawa, and Luna Tsukuyomi. They explain that they are from the Sefiro Fiore organization, which uses Elemental Tarot power to fight the evil creatures known as \"Daemonia.\"\n \nAkari discovers she too is a magical girl and has inherited her mother's power of The Sun card. However, she comes to realize Daemonia are actually people who have been possessed, and she must decide whether to try to save what is left of their humanity or to wipe them from existence. As Akari comes to terms with her grim duty of protecting the world from Daemonia, the bonds of the organization and that of their team will soon be strained when they deal with grave threats from the outside and from within.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "summer", "year": 2013, "broadcast": {"day": "Saturdays", "time": "23:30", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Saturdays at 23:30 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 17, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"}, {"mal_id": 139, "type": "anime", "name": "Nihon Ad Systems", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/139/Nihon_Ad_Systems"}, {"mal_id": 775, "type": "anime", "name": "Bushiroad", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/775/Bushiroad"}, {"mal_id": 1261, "type": "anime", "name": "Good Smile Company", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1261/Good_Smile_Company"}, {"mal_id": 1415, "type": "anime", "name": "Asahi Broadcasting", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1415/Asahi_Broadcasting"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 493, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex of America", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/493/Aniplex_of_America"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 48, "type": "anime", "name": "AIC", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/48/AIC"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 66, "type": "anime", "name": "Mahou Shoujo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/66/Mahou_Shoujo"}, {"mal_id": 40, "type": "anime", "name": "Psychological", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 10092, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/10092/Break_Blade_Movie_6__Doukoku_no_Toride", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/68089.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/68089t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/68089l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/68089.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/68089t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/68089l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "Iqft6dfYPwo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqft6dfYPwo", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/Iqft6dfYPwo?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/Iqft6dfYPwo/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/Iqft6dfYPwo/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/Iqft6dfYPwo/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/Iqft6dfYPwo/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/Iqft6dfYPwo/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Break Blade Movie 6: Doukoku no Toride"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Breaker Blade 6"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Break Blade 6: Enclave of Lamentations"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30af \u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30c9 \u7b2c\u516d\u7ae0 \u615f\u54ed\u30ce\u7826"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Broken Blade 6"}, {"type": "German", "title": "Broken Blade"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "Broken Blade"}, {"type": "French", "title": "Broken Blade"}], "title": "Break Blade Movie 6: Doukoku no Toride", "title_english": "Broken Blade 6", "title_japanese": "\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30af \u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30c9 \u7b2c\u516d\u7ae0 \u615f\u54ed\u30ce\u7826", "title_synonyms": ["Breaker Blade 6", "Break Blade 6: Enclave of Lamentations"], "type": "Movie", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2011-03-26T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 26, "month": 3, "year": 2011}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Mar 26, 2011"}, "duration": "52 min", "rating": "R -

And for Mayu, Airi, Minami, Yoshino, Nanami, Kaya and Miyu, it's going to be especially difficult knowing who to trust, as their manager Matsuda's lack of experience could give other, less scrupulous, individuals a chance to take advantage.\n\nThat's a situation that quickly comes to a head when Green Leaves' president suddenly disappears with most of the money, and things only get worse when the replacement producer seems more interested in getting the girls into revealing swimsuits than promoting their music.\n\nAs malicious gossip begins to surface regarding Mayu's past membership in a rival group, and internal tensions begin to tear the team apart, they'll need more than just ambition to survive. Singing may be a business, but friendship and a love of music is what will keep everything together.\n\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)", "background": "Wake Up, Girls! was announced by the production company Avex Entertainment, who helmed the series in collaboration with director Yutaka Yamamoto and voice talent agency 81 Produce.

Loran ends up spending a year on the planet working for the Heim Family, aristocrats living in a Victorian-like society. This family, like others of similar wealthy status, celebrates one's coming of age with a ceremony involving a giant stone statue known as the \"White Doll.\"\n\nTo Loran's surprise, the Moonrace suddenly touches down on Earth with the intent of taking it by force. During the attack, the White Doll is broken apart, revealing a mobile suit called the \"Turn A Gundam\" inside. With Loran in its cockpit, the Turn A causes a standoff between the forces of Earth and Moon. The young pilot, along with the people of both sides, must keep the peace and avoid another all-out, catastrophic war.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 1999, "broadcast": {"day": "Fridays", "time": "17:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Fridays at 17:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 64, "type": "anime", "name": "Sotsu", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/64/Sotsu"}, {"mal_id": 169, "type": "anime", "name": "Fuji TV", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/169/Fuji_TV"}, {"mal_id": 1260, "type": "anime", "name": "Nakamura Production", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1260/Nakamura_Production"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 217, "type": "anime", "name": "Nozomi Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/217/Nozomi_Entertainment"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 14, "type": "anime", "name": "Sunrise", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/14/Sunrise"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 46, "type": "anime", "name": "Award Winning", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/46/Award_Winning"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 18, "type": "anime", "name": "Mecha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}, {"mal_id": 38, "type": "anime", "name": "Military", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"}, {"mal_id": 29, "type": "anime", "name": "Space", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/29/Space"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 53450, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/53450/Xian_Wang_de_Richang_Shenghuo_4", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1443/138753.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1443/138753t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1443/138753l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1443/138753.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1443/138753t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1443/138753l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Xian Wang de Richang Shenghuo 4"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Xian Wang de Richang Shenghuo 4th Season"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "The Daily Life of the Immortal King 4th Season"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "\u4e0d\u6b7b\u8eab\u306a\u50d5\u306e\u65e5\u5e38 4\u671f"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u4ed9\u738b\u7684\u65e5\u5e38\u751f\u6d3b \u7b2c\u56db\u5b63"}, {"type": "English", "title": "The Daily Life of the Immortal King 4"}], "title": "Xian Wang de Richang Shenghuo 4", "title_english": "The Daily Life of the Immortal King 4", "title_japanese": "\u4ed9\u738b\u7684\u65e5\u5e38\u751f\u6d3b \u7b2c\u56db\u5b63", "title_synonyms": ["Xian Wang de Richang Shenghuo 4th Season", "The Daily Life of the Immortal King 4th Season", "\u4e0d\u6b7b\u8eab\u306a\u50d5\u306e\u65e5\u5e38 4\u671f"], "type": "ONA", "source": "Web novel", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2023-12-17T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2024-02-25T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 17, "month": 12, "year": 2023}, "to": {"day": 25, "month": 2, "year": 2024}}, "string": "Dec 17, 2023 to Feb 25, 2024"}, "duration": "18 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 -

Before long, Masaki encounters him again as a new classmate named Shou Akitsuki.\n\nShou is a skilled surfer and has been immersed in the sport since childhood. Even though surfing is the hobby of choice for Masaki's best friend, easygoing half-Hawaiian Nalu Tanaka, Masaki has never shown interest in trying it himself. But his admiration for Shou's surfing style finally inspires him to try the waves for the first time\u2014despite not knowing how to swim.\n\nOn the surfboard, Masaki shows surprising potential and talent for balance. He learns quickly and eventually enters a local competition, all with Shou and Tanaka by his side. However, behind Shou's gentle smile lurks a darker shadow, threatening to overwhelm his friends. Nonetheless, Masaki fearlessly steps into the fun world of surfing, stopping at nothing to be the very best.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "The series was originally screened in theatres as three movies in October 2020, before being broadcast on TV beginning in January 2021 with cuted to standard 30 minute timeslots.", "season": "winter", "year": 2021, "broadcast": {"day": "Tuesdays", "time": "02:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Tuesdays at 02:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 711, "type": "anime", "name": "Delfi Sound", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/711/Delfi_Sound"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 406, "type": "anime", "name": "Asahi Production", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/406/Asahi_Production"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 30, "type": "anime", "name": "Sports", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/30/Sports"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 49200, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/49200/Shiguang_Dailiren_Fanwai_Pian__Biwu_Zhaoqin", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1008/118860.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1008/118860t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1008/118860l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1008/118860.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1008/118860t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1008/118860l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Shiguang Dailiren Fanwai Pian: Biwu Zhaoqin"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Shiguang Dailiren Episode 5.5"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u65f6\u5149\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba \u756a\u5916\u7bc7 \u6bd4\u6b66\u62db\u4eb2"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Link Click Episode 5.5"}], "title": "Shiguang Dailiren Fanwai Pian: Biwu Zhaoqin", "title_english": "Link Click Episode 5.5", "title_japanese": "\u65f6\u5149\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba \u756a\u5916\u7bc7 \u6bd4\u6b66\u62db\u4eb2", "title_synonyms": ["Shiguang Dailiren Episode 5.5"], "type": "ONA", "source": "Original", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2021-05-28T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 28, "month": 5, "year": 2021}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "May 28, 2021"}, "duration": "22 min", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.81, "scored_by": 29386, "rank": 1058, "popularity": 3374, "members": 51792, "favorites": 138, "synopsis": "At the Time Photo Studio, partners Lu Guang and Cheng Xiaoshi accept jobs of a peculiar nature.

While the everyday crime in Tokyo continues, Seiji and the Special 7 will fight not only to resolve special cases, but also obstruct the ill-intentioned plans of the merciless group of Nine.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "fall", "year": 2019, "broadcast": {"day": "Sundays", "time": "21:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Sundays at 21:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 61, "type": "anime", "name": "Frontier Works", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/61/Frontier_Works"}, {"mal_id": 104, "type": "anime", "name": "Lantis", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/104/Lantis"}, {"mal_id": 167, "type": "anime", "name": "Sega", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/167/Sega"}, {"mal_id": 238, "type": "anime", "name": "AT-X", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"}, {"mal_id": 1041, "type": "anime", "name": "Ai Addiction", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1041/Ai_Addiction"}, {"mal_id": 1333, "type": "anime", "name": "Hakuhodo DY Music & Pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1333/Hakuhodo_DY_Music___Pictures"}, {"mal_id": 1492, "type": "anime", "name": "Yomiuri TV Enterprise", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1492/Yomiuri_TV_Enterprise"}, {"mal_id": 1696, "type": "anime", "name": "Kadokawa", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"}, {"mal_id": 1840, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai Namco Arts", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1840/Bandai_Namco_Arts"}, {"mal_id": 1985, "type": "anime", "name": "Toyo Recording", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1985/Toyo_Recording"}, {"mal_id": 1986, "type": "anime", "name": "arma bianca", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1986/arma_bianca"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 1983, "type": "anime", "name": "Anima&Co.", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1983/Anima_Co"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 7, "type": "anime", "name": "Mystery", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 39, "type": "anime", "name": "Detective", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/39/Detective"}, {"mal_id": 82, "type": "anime", "name": "Urban Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/82/Urban_Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 32, "type": "anime", "name": "Vampire", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/32/Vampire"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 57031, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/57031/Vampire_Dormitory", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1375/141863.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1375/141863t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1375/141863l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1375/141863.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1375/141863t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1375/141863l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "Y5K4iljAppE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5K4iljAppE", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y5K4iljAppE?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/Y5K4iljAppE/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/Y5K4iljAppE/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/Y5K4iljAppE/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/Y5K4iljAppE/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/Y5K4iljAppE/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Vampire Dormitory"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Vampire Danshiryou"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "A Vampire Lives in the Dormitory"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30f4\u30a1\u30f3\u30d1\u30a4\u30a2\u7537\u5b50\u5bee"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Vampire Dormitory"}], "title": "Vampire Dormitory", "title_english": "Vampire Dormitory", "title_japanese": "\u30f4\u30a1\u30f3\u30d1\u30a4\u30a2\u7537\u5b50\u5bee", "title_synonyms": ["Vampire Danshiryou", "A Vampire Lives in the Dormitory"], "type": "TV", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2024-04-07T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2024-06-23T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 7, "month": 4, "year": 2024}, "to": {"day": 23, "month": 6, "year": 2024}}, "string": "Apr 7, 2024 to Jun 23, 2024"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 -

Following the funeral of a fellow cadet, an unmotivated Shiro is walking in the city one night, when he bumps into Riquinni Nonderaiko, a young, pious woman, genuinely enthusiastic about the significance of space exploration.\n\nAs the two gradually bond, Riquinni's encouragement inspires Shiro to volunteer as a pilot for a prospective rocket ship, potentially becoming Honneamise's first man in space. Shiro and the RSF are soon joined by a team of elderly but eager scientists and engineers, and together, they embark on a mission to mold their nation's space program into a success. However, their efforts soon catch the attention of the government, which seems to have a different plan for the RSF in mind. Even as the odds are stacked against them, these men and women continue to stubbornly look to the sky, because somewhere among the frontiers of space may lie humanity's last chance at redemption.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Winner of the 1988 Seiun Award for Best Dramatic Presentation.", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 230, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/230/Bandai"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 490, "type": "anime", "name": "Maiden Japan", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/490/Maiden_Japan"}, {"mal_id": 947, "type": "anime", "name": "Manga Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/947/Manga_Entertainment"}, {"mal_id": 1466, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai Visual USA", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1466/Bandai_Visual_USA"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 6, "type": "anime", "name": "Gainax", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/6/Gainax"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 46, "type": "anime", "name": "Award Winning", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/46/Award_Winning"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 38, "type": "anime", "name": "Military", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"}, {"mal_id": 29, "type": "anime", "name": "Space", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/29/Space"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 37587, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/37587/Lapis_Re_LiGHTs", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1880/107611.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1880/107611t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1880/107611l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1880/107611.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1880/107611t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1880/107611l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "UlduXMSBCl4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlduXMSBCl4", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/UlduXMSBCl4?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/UlduXMSBCl4/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/UlduXMSBCl4/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/UlduXMSBCl4/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/UlduXMSBCl4/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/UlduXMSBCl4/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Lapis Re:LiGHTs"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30e9\u30d4\u30b9\u30ea\u30e9\u30a4\u30c4"}], "title": "Lapis Re:LiGHTs", "title_english": null, "title_japanese": "\u30e9\u30d4\u30b9\u30ea\u30e9\u30a4\u30c4", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "TV", "source": "Mixed media", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2020-07-04T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2020-09-19T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 4, "month": 7, "year": 2020}, "to": {"day": 19, "month": 9, "year": 2020}}, "string": "Jul 4, 2020 to Sep 19, 2020"}, "duration": "24 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 6.66, "scored_by": 17294, "rank": 6285, "popularity": 3426, "members": 50209, "favorites": 143, "synopsis": "Tiara, a princess from the kingdom of Waleland, travels to the city of Mamkestell to attend a prestigious academy for those who practice magic like herself.

With this monumental goal, could the weight of it all destroy the pair's friendship completely? \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "winter", "year": 2016, "broadcast": {"day": "Fridays", "time": "23:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Fridays at 23:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 104, "type": "anime", "name": "Lantis", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/104/Lantis"}, {"mal_id": 211, "type": "anime", "name": "Rakuonsha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/211/Rakuonsha"}, {"mal_id": 238, "type": "anime", "name": "AT-X", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"}, {"mal_id": 460, "type": "anime", "name": "KlockWorx", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/460/KlockWorx"}, {"mal_id": 1696, "type": "anime", "name": "Kadokawa", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 418, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio Gokumi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/418/Studio_Gokumi"}, {"mal_id": 1299, "type": "anime", "name": "AXsiZ", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1299/AXsiZ"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}, {"mal_id": 9, "type": "anime", "name": "Ecchi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/9/Ecchi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 34420, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/34420/Isekai_Izakaya__Koto_Aitheria_no_Izakaya_Nobu", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1303/90909.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1303/90909t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1303/90909l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1303/90909.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1303/90909t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1303/90909l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "NWjYkDKRVUY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWjYkDKRVUY", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/NWjYkDKRVUY?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/NWjYkDKRVUY/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/NWjYkDKRVUY/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/NWjYkDKRVUY/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/NWjYkDKRVUY/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/NWjYkDKRVUY/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Isekai Izakaya: Koto Aitheria no Izakaya Nobu"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u7570\u4e16\u754c\u5c45\u9152\u5c4b\uff5e\u53e4\u90fd\u30a2\u30a4\u30c6\u30fc\u30ea\u30a2\u306e\u5c45\u9152\u5c4b\u306e\u3076\uff5e"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Isekai Izakaya: Japanese Food From Another World"}, {"type": "German", "title": "Isekai Izakaya: Japanese Food From Another World"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "Isekai Izakaya: Japanese Food from another World"}, {"type": "French", "title": "Isekai Izakaya: Japanese Food From Another World"}], "title": "Isekai Izakaya: Koto Aitheria no Izakaya Nobu", "title_english": "Isekai Izakaya: Japanese Food From Another World", "title_japanese": "\u7570\u4e16\u754c\u5c45\u9152\u5c4b\uff5e\u53e4\u90fd\u30a2\u30a4\u30c6\u30fc\u30ea\u30a2\u306e\u5c45\u9152\u5c4b\u306e\u3076\uff5e", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "ONA", "source": "Light novel", "episodes": 24, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2018-04-13T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2018-09-14T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 13, "month": 4, "year": 2018}, "to": {"day": 14, "month": 9, "year": 2018}}, "string": "Apr 13, 2018 to Sep 14, 2018"}, "duration": "14 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.49, "scored_by": 18764, "rank": 2066, "popularity": 3462, "members": 49093, "favorites": 197, "synopsis": "Experienced head chef Nobuyuki Yazawa and friendly waitress Shinobu Senke run a traditional Japanese izakaya called Nobu\u2014a bar known for serving a tasty array of food and drink.

Thanks to these connections, Akio manages to find the retired designer of The Devil Z's engine, a solitary man named Jun Kitami. Following his meeting with Akio, Jun resumes building overpowered yet dangerous engines. Meanwhile, the racers of the Wangan Route are caught in a desperate race against The Devil Z with no clear end in sight.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "summer", "year": 2007, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": "Unknown"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 67, "type": "anime", "name": "OB Planning", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/67/OB_Planning"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 179, "type": "anime", "name": "A.C.G.T.", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/179/ACGT"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 3, "type": "anime", "name": "Racing", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/3/Racing"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 42, "type": "anime", "name": "Seinen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]}, {"mal_id": 995, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/995/Tennis_no_Oujisama__Zenkoku_Taikai-hen", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/10572.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/10572t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/10572l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/10572.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/10572t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/10572l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Tennis no Oujisama: Zenkoku Taikai-hen"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "PoT OVA"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Tennis no Ouji-sama: Zenkoku Taikai hen"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Prince of Tennis: The National Tournament"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30c6\u30cb\u30b9\u306e\u738b\u5b50\u69d8 Original Video Animation \u5168\u56fd\u5927\u4f1a\u7de8"}, {"type": "English", "title": "The Prince of Tennis: National Championship Chapter"}], "title": "Tennis no Oujisama: Zenkoku Taikai-hen", "title_english": "The Prince of Tennis: National Championship Chapter", "title_japanese": "\u30c6\u30cb\u30b9\u306e\u738b\u5b50\u69d8 Original Video Animation \u5168\u56fd\u5927\u4f1a\u7de8", "title_synonyms": ["PoT OVA", "Tennis no Ouji-sama: Zenkoku Taikai hen", "Prince of Tennis: The National Tournament"], "type": "OVA", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 13, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2006-03-24T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2007-03-23T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 24, "month": 3, "year": 2006}, "to": {"day": 23, "month": 3, "year": 2007}}, "string": "Mar 24, 2006 to Mar 23, 2007"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.87, "scored_by": 26423, "rank": 926, "popularity": 3473, "members": 48882, "favorites": 64, "synopsis": "Freshman tennis prodigy Ryouma Echizen and the Seishun Academy Boys' Tennis Team have finally reached the National Tournament, eager to fight for the championship title and claim it as their own.\n\nSeishun's first match is against Higa Middle School, the Okinawa-based team labeled as the \"dark horse\" of the tournament.

Their duty: to stop the darkest plots and eliminate the greatest threats. But in a city built on intrigue, can even a team of clairvoyants, telepaths and espers stand against the ultimate forces of destiny?\n\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)", "background": "Alongside and , Senkou no Night Raid was part of the \"Anime no Chikara\" project, a project to create more original anime, not based on any existing media.", "season": "spring", "year": 2010, "broadcast": {"day": "Tuesdays", "time": "01:30", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Tuesdays at 01:30 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 16, "type": "anime", "name": "TV Tokyo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"}, {"mal_id": 17, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"}, {"mal_id": 2946, "type": "anime", "name": "eNa", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2946/eNa"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 376, "type": "anime", "name": "Sentai Filmworks", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 56, "type": "anime", "name": "A-1 Pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/56/A-1_Pictures"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 13, "type": "anime", "name": "Historical", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}, {"mal_id": 38, "type": "anime", "name": "Military", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"}, {"mal_id": 31, "type": "anime", "name": "Super Power", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/31/Super_Power"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 618, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/618/Juubee_Ninpuuchou__Ryuuhougyoku-hen", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1898/103439.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1898/103439t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1898/103439l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1898/103439.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1898/103439t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1898/103439l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Juubee Ninpuuchou: Ryuuhougyoku-hen"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Juubee Ninpuuchou: Ryuuhougyoku Hen"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Jubei Ninpucho - Ryuhougyokuhen"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Jubei Ninpucho: Ryuhogyoku-Hen"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Wind Ninja Chronicles [Dragon Stone Chapter]"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Ninja Scroll - The Series"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u7363\u5175\u885b\u5fcd\u98a8\u5e16\u300c\u9f8d\u5b9d\u7389\u7bc7\u300d"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Ninja Scroll: The Series"}, {"type": "German", "title": "Ninja Scroll: Der Series"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "Ninja Scroll: La Serie"}, {"type": "French", "title": "Ninja Scroll: La S\u00e9rie"}], "title": "Juubee Ninpuuchou: Ryuuhougyoku-hen", "title_english": "Ninja Scroll: The Series", "title_japanese": "\u7363\u5175\u885b\u5fcd\u98a8\u5e16\u300c\u9f8d\u5b9d\u7389\u7bc7\u300d", "title_synonyms": ["Juubee Ninpuuchou: Ryuuhougyoku Hen", "Jubei Ninpucho - Ryuhougyokuhen", "Jubei Ninpucho: Ryuhogyoku-Hen", "Wind Ninja Chronicles [Dragon Stone Chapter]", "Ninja Scroll - The Series"], "type": "TV", "source": "Original", "episodes": 13, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2003-04-15T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2003-07-15T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 15, "month": 4, "year": 2003}, "to": {"day": 15, "month": 7, "year": 2003}}, "string": "Apr 15, 2003 to Jul 15, 2003"}, "duration": "24 min per ep", "rating": "R - 17+ (violence & profanity)", "score": 6.66, "scored_by": 19045, "rank": 6281, "popularity": 3550, "members": 47171, "favorites": 114, "synopsis": "Fourteen years after defeating the immortal warrior Himuro Genma and thwarting the Shogun of the Dark's evil plans, Kibagami Jubei continues to roam all over Japan as a masterless swordsman.

Knowing the situation, Rick and his co-workers, Nellis, Amyl, and Aerie decided to bring back peace to island and help Kaguya regain her lost memories and emotions. \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 2012, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": "Unknown"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 52, "type": "anime", "name": "Avex Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/52/Avex_Entertainment"}, {"mal_id": 167, "type": "anime", "name": "Sega", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/167/Sega"}, {"mal_id": 315, "type": "anime", "name": "DAX Production", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/315/DAX_Production"}, {"mal_id": 655, "type": "anime", "name": "Volks", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/655/Volks"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 376, "type": "anime", "name": "Sentai Filmworks", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Production I.G", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 47, "type": "anime", "name": "Gourmet", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/47/Gourmet"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 62, "type": "anime", "name": "Isekai", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/62/Isekai"}, {"mal_id": 48, "type": "anime", "name": "Workplace", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/48/Workplace"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 22071, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/22071/Mikakunin_de_Shinkoukei__Mite_Are_ga_Watashitachi_no_Tomatteiru_Ryokan_yo", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/76811.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/76811t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/76811l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/76811.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/76811t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/76811l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Mikakunin de Shinkoukei: Mite.
