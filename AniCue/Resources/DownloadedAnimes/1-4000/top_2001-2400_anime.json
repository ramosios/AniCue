While his master rushes to catch the train during the morning rush hour and works late into the night, the giant cat is diligently packing Saku's lunch, cooking her meals, cleaning their home, and buying groceries.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Dekiru Neko wa Kyou mo Yuuutsu was released on Blu-ray and DVD in four volumes from September 27, 2023, to December 20, 2023.", "season": "summer", "year": 2023, "broadcast": {"day": "Saturdays", "time": "02:23", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Saturdays at 02:23 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 61, "type": "anime", "name": "Frontier Works", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/61/Frontier_Works"}, {"mal_id": 143, "type": "anime", "name": "Mainichi Broadcasting System", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"}, {"mal_id": 159, "type": "anime", "name": "Kodansha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"}, {"mal_id": 166, "type": "anime", "name": "Movic", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"}, {"mal_id": 1333, "type": "anime", "name": "Hakuhodo DY Music & Pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1333/Hakuhodo_DY_Music___Pictures"}, {"mal_id": 1542, "type": "anime", "name": "DMM.com", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1542/DMMcom"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 309, "type": "anime", "name": "GoHands", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/309/GoHands"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 50, "type": "anime", "name": "Adult Cast", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"}, {"mal_id": 51, "type": "anime", "name": "Anthropomorphic", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/51/Anthropomorphic"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 15199, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/15199/Code_Geass__Boukoku_no_Akito_3_-_Kagayaku_Mono_Ten_yori_Otsu", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/72698.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/72698t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/72698l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/72698.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/72698t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/72698l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "uvv2XJzdzBA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvv2XJzdzBA", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/uvv2XJzdzBA?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/uvv2XJzdzBA/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/uvv2XJzdzBA/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/uvv2XJzdzBA/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/uvv2XJzdzBA/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/uvv2XJzdzBA/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Code Geass: Boukoku no Akito 3 - Kagayaku Mono Ten yori Otsu"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u30ae\u30a2\u30b9 \u4ea1\u56fd\u306e\u30a2\u30ad\u30c8 \u7b2c\uff13\u7ae0\u300c\u8f1d\u304f\u3082\u306e\u5929\u3088\u308a\u5815\u3064\u300d"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Code Geass: Akito the Exiled - The Brightness Falls"}, {"type": "German", "title": "Code Geass: Akito the Exiled - The Brightness Falls"}, {"type": "French", "title": "Code Geass: Akito The Exiled - Ce Qui Brille Tombe du Ciel"}], "title": "Code Geass: Boukoku no Akito 3 - Kagayaku Mono Ten yori Otsu", "title_english": "Code Geass: Akito the Exiled - The Brightness Falls", "title_japanese": "\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u30ae\u30a2\u30b9 \u4ea1\u56fd\u306e\u30a2\u30ad\u30c8 \u7b2c\uff13\u7ae0\u300c\u8f1d\u304f\u3082\u306e\u5929\u3088\u308a\u5815\u3064\u300d", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "Movie", "source": "Original", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2015-05-02T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 2, "month": 5, "year": 2015}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "May 2, 2015"}, "duration": "59 min", "rating": "R - 17+ (violence & profanity)", "score": 7.26, "scored_by": 58353, "rank": 3122, "popularity": 2027, "members": 120265, "favorites": 107, "synopsis": "After discovering the face of their true enemy\u2014someone who is related to Akito and responsible for the Geass placed upon him\u2014W-0 attempts to return to their base at Castle Weisswolf.

While Mireille is capable of fending off the assault, she discovers that Kirika is quite adept in combat situations after she takes out several gunmen on her own. Despite her proficiency at killing, Kirika laments her inability to feel remorse for her victims. In addition, Kirika apparently has no memory of how she came to acquire the skills she possesses or even of her real identity.\n\nSensing shared history between them, Mireille agrees to team up with Kirika, and together, they embark on a journey to uncover the mysteries of their pasts.

Caught up in this mess are Hikaru Ichijou, a free-spirited acrobatic pilot, and Minmay Lynn, an aspiring singer. These two, alongside Macross' crew, experience an epic journey rife with grief and drama, coming face-to-face with the cruelties of war along the way.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "fall", "year": 1982, "broadcast": {"day": "Sundays", "time": "14:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Sundays at 14:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Artland", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/8/Artland"}, {"mal_id": 143, "type": "anime", "name": "Mainichi Broadcasting System", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"}, {"mal_id": 199, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio Nue", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/199/Studio_Nue"}, {"mal_id": 351, "type": "anime", "name": "Big West", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/351/Big_West"}, {"mal_id": 1990, "type": "anime", "name": "Anime Friend", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1990/Anime_Friend"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 97, "type": "anime", "name": "ADV Films", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/97/ADV_Films"}, {"mal_id": 310, "type": "anime", "name": "AnimEigo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/310/AnimEigo"}, {"mal_id": 2278, "type": "anime", "name": "Harmony Gold", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2278/Harmony_Gold"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 103, "type": "anime", "name": "Tatsunoko Production", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/103/Tatsunoko_Production"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 18, "type": "anime", "name": "Mecha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}, {"mal_id": 38, "type": "anime", "name": "Military", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"}, {"mal_id": 19, "type": "anime", "name": "Music", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/19/Music"}, {"mal_id": 29, "type": "anime", "name": "Space", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/29/Space"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 8934, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/8934/Star_Driver__Kagayaki_no_Takuto", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/25953.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/25953t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/25953l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/25953.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/25953t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/25953l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Star Driver: Kagayaki no Takuto"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "STAR DRIVER: Shining Takuto"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "STAR DRIVER \u8f1d\u304d\u306e\u30bf\u30af\u30c8"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Star Driver"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "Star Driver"}], "title": "Star Driver: Kagayaki no Takuto", "title_english": "Star Driver", "title_japanese": "STAR DRIVER \u8f1d\u304d\u306e\u30bf\u30af\u30c8", "title_synonyms": ["STAR DRIVER: Shining Takuto"], "type": "TV", "source": "Original", "episodes": 25, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2010-10-03T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2011-04-03T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 3, "month": 10, "year": 2010}, "to": {"day": 3, "month": 4, "year": 2011}}, "string": "Oct 3, 2010 to Apr 3, 2011"}, "duration": "25 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.18, "scored_by": 46661, "rank": 3577, "popularity": 2039, "members": 119399, "favorites": 622, "synopsis": "Deep beneath the surface of Southern Cross Isle, a mysterious organization known as the Glittering Crux Brigade frequently gathers in their underground fortress.

One such institution is the elite Yuyu Girls' Vocational High School, where both Serufu Yua and her childhood friend, Miku \"Purin\" Suride, have applied. Although the tech-savvy Purin is accepted to Yuyu High, the accident-prone Serufu is rejected and enters the traditional Gatagata Girls' High School instead, driving a wedge into their friendship.\n\nOn her way to class one day, Serufu gets into a bike accident, and Rei Yasaku, a passerby who attends the same school, fixes her damaged bicycle. Serufu later finds out that Rei has a passion for old-fashioned crafts and is the head of the school's Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Club\u2014which is in danger of closing due to a lack of members.\n\nRealizing that this may be her chance to repair her relationship with Purin, Serufu joins the club in hopes of creating projects that could bring them together once more. As the DIY Club welcomes new faces, Serufu learns to build not only handicrafts but also new friendships along the way!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Do It Yourself! was released on Blu-ray and DVD in four volumes from December 23, 2022 to March 24, 2023.

At the prefectural tournament, Kuroba crumbles under the pressure, which causes the Monshiro team to fall apart after losing. The loss also creates a rift between Haijima and Kuroba, leading the former to quit the team.\n\nNow, as students at Seiin High School, Haijima and Kuroba find themselves on the same volleyball team once again. Having learned from his past mistakes, Haijima helps Kuroba overcome his performance anxiety to become the ace and carry the team to the prefectural championship. With support from team captain Shinichirou Oda and vice captain Misao Aoki, Seiin aim to win the prefecturals and become Fukui's representatives at the Spring Tournament. To do this, they will need to beat Fukuho Technical High School, the reigning champions of Fukui. Will Haijima's team defeat the odds, or are they doomed to repeat his history of losing?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "winter", "year": 2021, "broadcast": {"day": "Fridays", "time": "00:55", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Fridays at 00:55 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 17, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"}, {"mal_id": 53, "type": "anime", "name": "Dentsu", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/53/Dentsu"}, {"mal_id": 140, "type": "anime", "name": "Animax", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/140/Animax"}, {"mal_id": 166, "type": "anime", "name": "Movic", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"}, {"mal_id": 169, "type": "anime", "name": "Fuji TV", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/169/Fuji_TV"}, {"mal_id": 769, "type": "anime", "name": "Fujipacific Music", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/769/Fujipacific_Music"}, {"mal_id": 1365, "type": "anime", "name": "Shueisha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1365/Shueisha"}, {"mal_id": 1556, "type": "anime", "name": "Fuji Creative", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1556/Fuji_Creative"}, {"mal_id": 1734, "type": "anime", "name": "Tohan Corporation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1734/Tohan_Corporation"}, {"mal_id": 2180, "type": "anime", "name": "Japan Volleyball Association", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2180/Japan_Volleyball_Association"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 287, "type": "anime", "name": "David Production", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/287/David_Production"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 30, "type": "anime", "name": "Sports", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/30/Sports"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}, {"mal_id": 77, "type": "anime", "name": "Team Sports", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/77/Team_Sports"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 25687, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/25687/Digimon_Adventure_tri_1__Saikai", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/75493.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/75493t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/75493l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/75493.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/75493t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/75493l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "e7_va5mh-GU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7_va5mh-GU", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/e7_va5mh-GU?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/e7_va5mh-GU/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/e7_va5mh-GU/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/e7_va5mh-GU/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/e7_va5mh-GU/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/e7_va5mh-GU/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Digimon Adventure tri. 1: Saikai"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Digimon tri. 1"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30c7\u30b8\u30e2\u30f3\u30a2\u30c9\u30d9\u30f3\u30c1\u30e3\u30fctri.\uff08\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\uff09\u7b2c\uff11\u7ae0\u300c\u518d\u4f1a\u300d"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Digimon Adventure tri.

One such community known as the \"Tanuki,\" a type of magical shape-shifting mammal, is caught up in a struggle to defend their beloved forest from being absorbed by the looming threat of an expanding Tokyo.\n\nAs more and more Tanuki find themselves with nowhere to hide and territorial fights become increasingly regular amongst the different factions of the community, the elder Tanuki Oroku decides that something must be done. For the sake of their home as well as the safety of their future generations, the Tanuki unite as one with the hope that together they may be able to repel mankind's construction projects and scare them away from the forests using their shapeshifting abilities.\n\nBut as they begin their first attempts at sabotage, the Tanuki soon realize the operation will be no easy task.

Sadly, being too young, she can only watch as her elder sister, Yang Xiao Long, sets off for the academy alone. But everything changes when Ruby fights off a group of armed robbers, and the news of her skillful exploit reaches Beacon's headmaster, Professor Ozpin.\n\nRuby is over the moon when she receives an invitation to join the academy alongside her sister. Meanwhile, halfway across the world in the kingdom of Atlas, corporate heiress Weiss Schnee defies her father's wish and sets off for Beacon, her heart brimming with anxious resolve. At the same time, lonesome rogue Blake Belladonna abandons her vigilante group in hopes of finding a better life at the academy. When their paths converge, the meeting between the four girls is anything but friendly. With vastly different personalities and beliefs, they often end up clashing. However, when they work together, team RWBY begins to create ripples across Beacon, the likes of which have never been seen before.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "summer", "year": 2022, "broadcast": {"day": "Sundays", "time": "22:30", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Sundays at 22:30 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 415, "type": "anime", "name": "Warner Bros.

One day, two shinigami\u2014Meroko Yui and Takuto Kira\u2014appear to tell her that she only has one year left to live. This sudden revelation spurs Mitsuki into action, and she decides that with Meroko and Takuto's help, she will become a professional singer in the time she has left.\n\nFull Moon wo Sagashite follows the emotional story of Mitsuki and her shinigami friends as they discover what it means to sing\u2014and ultimately, what it means to live.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Full Moon wo Sagashite only follows its manga source for about one episode before going down a different route.

Claimed to possess mystic abilities, she is said to take on any request\u2014from finding lost items to inflicting curses. While some call her an immortal sage, others believe her to be a terrifying revenant. But such comments fail to faze Jusetsu, who prefers to spend her days in quiet solitude. That is, until the emperor, Ka Koushun, barges into her court and asks for her assistance with a mysterious case.\n\nThe young emperor's request requires Jusetsu to step out of her palace for the first time. Despite Ka Koushun's frequent visits annoying her to no end, she cannot bring herself to turn him away. Her predecessor's teachings echo in her ears: the Raven Consort is destined to remain forever alone and never desire anything. Yet Jusetsu finds herself making the first of several bonds when she asks Jiujiu, an innocently inquisitive court girl, to be her sole attendant.\n\nTogether, they begin fulfilling requests from the people of the palace. However, unknown perils lurk in the outside world, and drawing attention to herself may bring Jusetsu face-to-face with a past that is better left undisturbed.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Koukyuu no Karasu was released on Blu-ray and DVD in six volumes from December 21, 2022 to May 24, 2023.", "season": "fall", "year": 2022, "broadcast": {"day": "Saturdays", "time": "23:30", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Saturdays at 23:30 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 17, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"}, {"mal_id": 166, "type": "anime", "name": "Movic", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"}, {"mal_id": 1365, "type": "anime", "name": "Shueisha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1365/Shueisha"}, {"mal_id": 1412, "type": "anime", "name": "Kansai Telecasting", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1412/Kansai_Telecasting"}, {"mal_id": 1416, "type": "anime", "name": "BS11", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1416/BS11"}, {"mal_id": 1734, "type": "anime", "name": "Tohan Corporation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1734/Tohan_Corporation"}, {"mal_id": 1800, "type": "anime", "name": "Marui Group", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1800/Marui_Group"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 1258, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai Namco Pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1258/Bandai_Namco_Pictures"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 7, "type": "anime", "name": "Mystery", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 13, "type": "anime", "name": "Historical", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}, {"mal_id": 6, "type": "anime", "name": "Mythology", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/6/Mythology"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 43, "type": "anime", "name": "Josei", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/43/Josei"}]}, {"mal_id": 39651, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/39651/Mob_Psycho_100__Dai_Ikkai_Rei_toka_Soudansho_Ian_Ryokou_-_Kokoro_Mitasu_Iyashi_no_Tabi", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1605/119301.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1605/119301t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1605/119301l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1605/119301.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1605/119301t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1605/119301l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "x2wIub86shk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2wIub86shk", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/x2wIub86shk?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/x2wIub86shk/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/x2wIub86shk/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/x2wIub86shk/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/x2wIub86shk/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/x2wIub86shk/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Mob Psycho 100: Dai Ikkai Rei toka Soudansho Ian Ryokou -

Hyung Suk quickly realizes that he is now the owner of two disparate bodies; when one falls asleep, he wakes up in the other.\n\nFeeling like he has won the lottery of life, Hyung Suk enters his new school as this attractive and strong young man.

He's literally part wolf and has the amazing ability to extract critical information just by examining or tasting a sample of someone's hair! Of course, that ability has also resulted in Inaba having a little bit of a hair fetish, but that doesn't seem to be a problem for his two assistants. (Well, at least the cross-dressing one isn't complaining much.) And it's nothing compared to the strange tastes of Inaba's nemesis, the omnivorous (and half goat) crime boss Don Valentino, who has an appetite for green legal tender instead of tender young greens! Inaba's sworn to cut Valentino out of the criminal flock before the Don can wolf down more ill-gotten dough, but he's going to have to chew his way through a lot of evidence to get his goat. Can sheer dogged detective work put the baaaaad guys behind bars?\n\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)", "background": "", "season": "winter", "year": 2013, "broadcast": {"day": "Fridays", "time": "23:30", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Fridays at 23:30 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 61, "type": "anime", "name": "Frontier Works", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/61/Frontier_Works"}, {"mal_id": 108, "type": "anime", "name": "Media Factory", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/108/Media_Factory"}, {"mal_id": 238, "type": "anime", "name": "AT-X", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"}, {"mal_id": 777, "type": "anime", "name": "Showgate", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/777/Showgate"}, {"mal_id": 789, "type": "anime", "name": "BIGLOBE", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/789/BIGLOBE"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 376, "type": "anime", "name": "Sentai Filmworks", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 218, "type": "anime", "name": "Zexcs", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/218/Zexcs"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 7, "type": "anime", "name": "Mystery", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 39, "type": "anime", "name": "Detective", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/39/Detective"}, {"mal_id": 57, "type": "anime", "name": "Gag Humor", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/57/Gag_Humor"}, {"mal_id": 68, "type": "anime", "name": "Organized Crime", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/68/Organized_Crime"}, {"mal_id": 82, "type": "anime", "name": "Urban Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/82/Urban_Fantasy"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]}, {"mal_id": 43756, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/43756/Bakuten", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1827/113510.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1827/113510t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1827/113510l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1827/113510.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1827/113510t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1827/113510l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "IOu25DQuc3Q", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOu25DQuc3Q", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/IOu25DQuc3Q?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/IOu25DQuc3Q/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/IOu25DQuc3Q/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/IOu25DQuc3Q/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/IOu25DQuc3Q/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/IOu25DQuc3Q/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Bakuten!!"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30d0\u30af\u30c6\u30f3!!"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Backflip!!"}, {"type": "German", "title": "Backflip!!"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "Backflip!!"}, {"type": "French", "title": "Backflip!!"}], "title": "Bakuten!!", "title_english": "Backflip!!", "title_japanese": "\u30d0\u30af\u30c6\u30f3!!", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "TV", "source": "Original", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2021-04-09T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2021-06-25T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 9, "month": 4, "year": 2021}, "to": {"day": 25, "month": 6, "year": 2021}}, "string": "Apr 9, 2021 to Jun 25, 2021"}, "duration": "22 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.48, "scored_by": 41428, "rank": 2097, "popularity": 2123, "members": 112689, "favorites": 924, "synopsis": "Shoutarou Futaba has always loved sports, but he never became more than a benchwarmer on his middle school baseball team.

They pilot advanced mecha suits called Aquaria and are strictly separated by gender. Boys and girls are not allowed contact; they are even restrained from fighting on the same battlefield. However, events take a shocking turn when an advanced Abductor mecha suit joins the fray. Two teenagers, Mikono and Amata, are dragged into the conflict. Unknowingly, Amata performs a taboo when he summons an Aquaria and initializes what is called the Forbidden Union between male and female Aquaria. Neo-DEAVA is shocked, and the repercussions of Amata\u2019s actions are much farther reaching than he realizes. How was he able to summon an Aquaria? Where did he learn to form a Forbidden Union?

And although Shinku and the other dolls idly pass the days by in the comfort of Jun's home, dark times lie ahead as a new foe presents herself: Barasuishou, the seventh Rozen Maiden.\n\nBut Barasuishou is a mystery even to her sisters, none of whom have ever laid eyes on her until now.

Seeing his disinterest as something to be rectified, Mona pulls out all the stops in the hopes of winning Medaka over, only to be met with one stern face after another.\n\nTurns out, Medaka's indifference to Mona stems from his wish to one day become a monk, and hence must leave all worldly desires behind.

The character designer was different from the one who handled the TV series, resulting in the characters' modeling more closely to the manga's creator Rumiko Takahashi's art style. In Japan, there were two DVD releases: one on August 21, 2002 and another on November 26, 2004. The first included a bonus CD with an original audio drama titled Inuyasha - Toki wo Koeru Mou Hitotsu no Omoi, while the second was a standard edition single disc.

The series then turns to the year 1999, where Maya returns to the Academy with the intention of destroying the Academy by superseding her late father's position as the principal. Her plan was interrupted when she meets Fumiaki and learns of the forthcoming destruction. Despite being distrusting towards Fumiaki, they form a pact to look for the Nostradamus Key.\n\nIn order to find the Nostradamus Key, time agents were provided with specially created cell phones. When a user finds an object of interest, by thinking of destroying it and taking a photo, and if the resulting image is that of a peaceful world, then the subject is the Nostradamus Key. Conversely, if the subject is not the Nostradamus Key, then the photo displays destruction. By using the phone, Maya and Fumiaki investigates occult occurrences as they occur in the town.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)", "background": "Alongside and , Seikimatsu Occult Gakuin was part of the \"Anime no Chikara\" project, a project to create more original anime, not based on any existing media.", "season": "summer", "year": 2010, "broadcast": {"day": "Tuesdays", "time": "01:30", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Tuesdays at 01:30 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 17, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"}, {"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Xebec", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/27/Xebec"}, {"mal_id": 717, "type": "anime", "name": "TV Tokyo Music", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/717/TV_Tokyo_Music"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 372, "type": "anime", "name": "NIS America, Inc.", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/372/NIS_America_Inc"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 56, "type": "anime", "name": "A-1 Pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/56/A-1_Pictures"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 7, "type": "anime", "name": "Mystery", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}, {"mal_id": 37, "type": "anime", "name": "Supernatural", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}, {"mal_id": 78, "type": "anime", "name": "Time Travel", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/78/Time_Travel"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 35078, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/35078/Mitsuboshi_Colors", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/89984.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/89984t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/89984l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/89984.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/89984t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/89984l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "lqDhsdx_oqs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqDhsdx_oqs", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/lqDhsdx_oqs?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/lqDhsdx_oqs/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/lqDhsdx_oqs/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/lqDhsdx_oqs/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/lqDhsdx_oqs/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/lqDhsdx_oqs/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Mitsuboshi Colors"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u4e09\u30c4\u661f\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u30ba"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Mitsuboshi Colors"}], "title": "Mitsuboshi Colors", "title_english": "Mitsuboshi Colors", "title_japanese": "\u4e09\u30c4\u661f\u30ab\u30e9\u30fc\u30ba", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "TV", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2018-01-07T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2018-03-25T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 7, "month": 1, "year": 2018}, "to": {"day": 25, "month": 3, "year": 2018}}, "string": "Jan 7, 2018 to Mar 25, 2018"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.41, "scored_by": 36720, "rank": 2395, "popularity": 2180, "members": 107964, "favorites": 350, "synopsis": "Residing within Tokyo's district of Ueno are the Colors, three individuals who protect their city by performing good deeds and aiding their community.

Deep in the forest, the cat takes her to a clearing with dead trees and brown grass, where the only sign of life is a cluster of mysterious blue flowers that Mary has never seen before. The gardener of the estate later tells her that the rare species is called \"Fly-by-Night,\" and is said to be sought by witches for its incredible magical power.\n\nWhen the strange cat returns to her one night, Mary is led once again into the woods, but this time to an old broomstick hidden by a gnarled tree.

Wary of joining another mercenary group, Kougami declines to join his cause, but agrees to be driven to the nearby Tibetan capital by one of Garcia's men.\n\nHowever, Kougami's plan to remain uninvolved is short-lived when a bus of refugees are ambushed by armed guerrillas. Among them is a half-Japanese, half-Tibetan girl named Tenzing Wangchuck. Impressed with Kougami's fighting prowess as he single-handedly takes the attackers out, Wangchuck requests him to teach her how to fight so she can take revenge against the warlord who murdered her family. \n\nKnowing first-hand that there is no turning back to the person you were once you take a human life, Kougami is initially reluctant to accept her request. But faced with the girl's desire for vengeance that mirrors the haunting abyss inside his own heart, will he train her?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 53, "type": "anime", "name": "Dentsu", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/53/Dentsu"}, {"mal_id": 169, "type": "anime", "name": "Fuji TV", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/169/Fuji_TV"}, {"mal_id": 459, "type": "anime", "name": "Nitroplus", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/459/Nitroplus"}, {"mal_id": 757, "type": "anime", "name": "Sony Music Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/757/Sony_Music_Entertainment"}, {"mal_id": 1143, "type": "anime", "name": "TOHO animation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1143/TOHO_animation"}, {"mal_id": 1996, "type": "anime", "name": "MAGNET", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1996/MAGNET"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Production I.G", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 7, "type": "anime", "name": "Mystery", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}, {"mal_id": 41, "type": "anime", "name": "Suspense", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/41/Suspense"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 50, "type": "anime", "name": "Adult Cast", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"}, {"mal_id": 39, "type": "anime", "name": "Detective", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/39/Detective"}, {"mal_id": 40, "type": "anime", "name": "Psychological", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 102, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/102/Aishiteruze_Baby\u2605\u2605", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/69665.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/69665t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/69665l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/69665.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/69665t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/69665l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Aishiteruze Baby\u2605\u2605"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Aishiteru ze Baby"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Love You Baby"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "I Love You"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Baby"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u611b\u3057\u3066\u308b\u305c \u30d9\u30a4\u30d9\u2605\u2605"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Babe, My Love"}, {"type": "French", "title": "Babe My Love"}], "title": "Aishiteruze Baby\u2605\u2605", "title_english": "Babe, My Love", "title_japanese": "\u611b\u3057\u3066\u308b\u305c \u30d9\u30a4\u30d9\u2605\u2605", "title_synonyms": ["Aishiteru ze Baby", "Love You Baby", "I Love You", "Baby"], "type": "TV", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 26, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2004-04-03T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2004-10-09T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 3, "month": 4, "year": 2004}, "to": {"day": 9, "month": 10, "year": 2004}}, "string": "Apr 3, 2004 to Oct 9, 2004"}, "duration": "25 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.43, "scored_by": 54895, "rank": 2279, "popularity": 2202, "members": 106316, "favorites": 560, "synopsis": "Katakura Kippei is in every way a high school playboy.

He finally decides to return after hearing that his father\u2014owner of the Kyoto sweets store Ryokushou\u2014has been hospitalized. Worrying that no one would inherit the shop if his father passes away, Nagomu prepares himself to embrace his family's legacy and the art of making sweets\u2060.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Nagomu discovers that his father has already chosen a different successor\u2014a 10-year-old girl named Itsuka Yukihira, who was abandoned at Ryokushou by her father for reasons unknown. While she has since become a part of the family and is now the shop's poster girl, Itsuka still longs to see her father and follows all possible clues that may lead her to him. Sympathizing with Itsuka's situation, Nagomu's mother asks Nagomu to act as Itsuka's father, hoping that Itsuka will open up to him and relieve her pain, even if just a little.\n\nStarting on bad terms, Itsuka and Nagomu gradually learn more about each other, realizing that they are more similar than they had thought. Connected by their mutual love for both Ryokushou and its confections, their relationship as child and father figure begins to make lives around them a little bit sweeter.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Deaimon was released on Blu-ray and DVD on August 24, 2022.", "season": "spring", "year": 2022, "broadcast": {"day": "Wednesdays", "time": "23:30", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Wednesdays at 23:30 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 464, "type": "anime", "name": "flying DOG", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/464/flying_DOG"}, {"mal_id": 1696, "type": "anime", "name": "Kadokawa", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"}, {"mal_id": 2308, "type": "anime", "name": "Midorimatsu", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2308/Midorimatsu"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 354, "type": "anime", "name": "Encourage Films", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/354/Encourage_Films"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 36, "type": "anime", "name": "Slice of Life", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 53, "type": "anime", "name": "Childcare", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/53/Childcare"}, {"mal_id": 48, "type": "anime", "name": "Workplace", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/48/Workplace"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 42, "type": "anime", "name": "Seinen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]}, {"mal_id": 16774, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/16774/Inferno_Cop", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/47037.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/47037t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/47037l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/47037.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/47037t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/47037l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "Ky0WPP0ZHF8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ky0WPP0ZHF8", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ky0WPP0ZHF8?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/Ky0WPP0ZHF8/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/Ky0WPP0ZHF8/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/Ky0WPP0ZHF8/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/Ky0WPP0ZHF8/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/Ky0WPP0ZHF8/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Inferno Cop"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30a4\u30f3\u30d5\u30a7\u30eb\u30ce\u30b3\u30c3\u30d7"}], "title": "Inferno Cop", "title_english": null, "title_japanese": "\u30a4\u30f3\u30d5\u30a7\u30eb\u30ce\u30b3\u30c3\u30d7", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "ONA", "source": "Original", "episodes": 13, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2012-12-25T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2013-03-19T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 25, "month": 12, "year": 2012}, "to": {"day": 19, "month": 3, "year": 2013}}, "string": "Dec 25, 2012 to Mar 19, 2013"}, "duration": "3 min per ep", "rating": "R - 17+ (violence & profanity)", "score": 7.21, "scored_by": 59481, "rank": 3406, "popularity": 2211, "members": 105723, "favorites": 1125, "synopsis": "Jack Knife Edge Town is as edgy as it sounds, and it's up to Inferno Cop to stop that edge from tearing his city apart.

Senya takes a shine to him because of the young man's fervent aspiration\u2014despite it only being the loss of his virginity. While Arajin would be the first to flee from a fight, Senya lending him his powers helps the lovesick boy to hold his own against the likes of Marito, although this only raises the interest of both gangs in recruiting him. As the turf wars heat up when a third gang joins the fray, Arajin's involvement may be unavoidable.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Bucchigiri?! was released on Blu-ray and DVD in four volumes by Toho from April 17, 2024, to July 17, 2024.", "season": "winter", "year": 2024, "broadcast": {"day": "Saturdays", "time": "23:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Saturdays at 23:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 1143, "type": "anime", "name": "TOHO animation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1143/TOHO_animation"}, {"mal_id": 1856, "type": "anime", "name": "dugout", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1856/dugout"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 1468, "type": "anime", "name": "Crunchyroll", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1468/Crunchyroll"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 569, "type": "anime", "name": "MAPPA", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/569/MAPPA"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 37, "type": "anime", "name": "Supernatural", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 55, "type": "anime", "name": "Delinquents", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/55/Delinquents"}, {"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 11077, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/11077/Hellsing__The_Dawn", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/30667.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/30667t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/30667l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/30667.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/30667t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/30667l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Hellsing: The Dawn"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Hellsing: The Dawn - A supplementary of HELLSING"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Hellsing OVA Specials"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Hellsing Ultimate Specials"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Drifters"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "HELLSING THE DAWN"}], "title": "Hellsing: The Dawn", "title_english": null, "title_japanese": "HELLSING THE DAWN", "title_synonyms": ["Hellsing: The Dawn - A supplementary of HELLSING", "Hellsing OVA Specials", "Hellsing Ultimate Specials", "Drifters"], "type": "Special", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 3, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2011-07-27T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2012-12-26T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 27, "month": 7, "year": 2011}, "to": {"day": 26, "month": 12, "year": 2012}}, "string": "Jul 27, 2011 to Dec 26, 2012"}, "duration": "10 min per ep", "rating": "R - 17+ (violence & profanity)", "score": 7.11, "scored_by": 44892, "rank": 3986, "popularity": 2218, "members": 105185, "favorites": 154, "synopsis": "During the height of World War II, Nazi Germany seeks to strengthen their soldiers with technology crafted under the influence of vampiric biology.

Acting as a professional negotiator and suave agent, Roger is a self-tailored ladies man whose only love is for funeral black. However, as he gets deeply involved with his clients, what often starts as a simple negotiation evolves into Roger saving Paradigm from crime and peril.\n\nIn the process, Roger stumbles even deeper into the untold folds of the city. As a rule, things are hardly ever as they appear. Serving as gray knight in a gray world, Roger is not without allies. By his side are Norman, a loyal and widely skilled butler, and Dorothy, a human-like android with deadpan snark. Together with the relic Big O, a jet-black mecha of gargantuan size and weight, they help Roger serve iron justice to Paradigm's lurking villains as he discovers the truth about 40 years ago.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "fall", "year": 1999, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": "Unknown"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai Visual", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/23/Bandai_Visual"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 233, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/233/Bandai_Entertainment"}, {"mal_id": 376, "type": "anime", "name": "Sentai Filmworks", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 14, "type": "anime", "name": "Sunrise", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/14/Sunrise"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 7, "type": "anime", "name": "Mystery", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 50, "type": "anime", "name": "Adult Cast", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"}, {"mal_id": 18, "type": "anime", "name": "Mecha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}, {"mal_id": 40, "type": "anime", "name": "Psychological", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 37994, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/37994/B__The_Beginning_Succession", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1409/112177.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1409/112177t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1409/112177l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1409/112177.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1409/112177t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1409/112177l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "afN1XtfszYU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afN1XtfszYU", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/afN1XtfszYU?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/afN1XtfszYU/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/afN1XtfszYU/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/afN1XtfszYU/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/afN1XtfszYU/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/afN1XtfszYU/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "B: The Beginning Succession"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "B: The Beginning 2nd Season"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "B: The Beginning Succession"}, {"type": "English", "title": "B: The Beginning Succession"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "B: The Beginning Temporada 2: Sucesi\u00f3n"}], "title": "B: The Beginning Succession", "title_english": "B: The Beginning Succession", "title_japanese": "B: The Beginning Succession", "title_synonyms": ["B: The Beginning 2nd Season"], "type": "ONA", "source": "Original", "episodes": 6, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2021-03-18T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 18, "month": 3, "year": 2021}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Mar 18, 2021"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "R - 17+ (violence & profanity)", "score": 6.2, "scored_by": 34415, "rank": 9027, "popularity": 2242, "members": 104096, "favorites": 179, "synopsis": "In the first season of B: The Beginning, two men confronted their own past with great sacrifice.

It turns out life can go by in the blink of an eye, fast enough to even miss it, so what's with these weird robots that seem to show up at the worst times?!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "FLCL Alternative aired in the United States as a six-episode television series as part of the Toonami line-up on the Adult Swim programming block of Cartoon Network.", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 245, "type": "anime", "name": "TOHO", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/245/TOHO"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Production I.G", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"}, {"mal_id": 1567, "type": "anime", "name": "Nut", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1567/Nut"}, {"mal_id": 1692, "type": "anime", "name": "Revoroot", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1692/Revoroot"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 5, "type": "anime", "name": "Avant Garde", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/5/Avant_Garde"}, {"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 18, "type": "anime", "name": "Mecha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}, {"mal_id": 20, "type": "anime", "name": "Parody", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/20/Parody"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 33573, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/33573/BanG_Dream", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/82414.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/82414t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/82414l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/82414.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/82414t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/82414l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "yNMj1ZwB9QY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNMj1ZwB9QY", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/yNMj1ZwB9QY?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/yNMj1ZwB9QY/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/yNMj1ZwB9QY/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/yNMj1ZwB9QY/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/yNMj1ZwB9QY/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/yNMj1ZwB9QY/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "BanG Dream!"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "BanG Dream!\uff08\u30d0\u30f3\u30c9\u30ea\uff01\uff09"}, {"type": "English", "title": "BanG Dream!"}], "title": "BanG Dream!", "title_english": "BanG Dream!", "title_japanese": "BanG Dream!\uff08\u30d0\u30f3\u30c9\u30ea\uff01\uff09", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "TV", "source": "Mixed media", "episodes": 13, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2017-01-21T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2017-04-22T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 21, "month": 1, "year": 2017}, "to": {"day": 22, "month": 4, "year": 2017}}, "string": "Jan 21, 2017 to Apr 22, 2017"}, "duration": "24 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 6.99, "scored_by": 42162, "rank": 4545, "popularity": 2263, "members": 102143, "favorites": 871, "synopsis": "When Kasumi Toyama was out camping as a child, she heard the rhythm of the \"Star Beat\" while admiring the starry night sky.

Distraught, she quickly decides to save him by integrating his consciousness into her body.\n\nNow, Birdy and Senkawa must not only cohabitate the same body, but also balance Senkawa's high school life, Shion Arita's modeling career, and Birdy's increasingly dangerous job as a Federation officer.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "summer", "year": 2008, "broadcast": {"day": "Saturdays", "time": "01:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Saturdays at 01:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 17, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"}, {"mal_id": 1430, "type": "anime", "name": "Shogakukan", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1430/Shogakukan"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 56, "type": "anime", "name": "A-1 Pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/56/A-1_Pictures"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 42, "type": "anime", "name": "Seinen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]}, {"mal_id": 55855, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/55855/Kuroshitsuji__Kishuku_Gakkou-hen", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1505/141820.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1505/141820t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1505/141820l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1505/141820.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1505/141820t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1505/141820l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "a-5NVZrsS-0", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-5NVZrsS-0", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/a-5NVZrsS-0?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/a-5NVZrsS-0/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/a-5NVZrsS-0/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/a-5NVZrsS-0/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/a-5NVZrsS-0/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/a-5NVZrsS-0/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Kuroshitsuji: Kishuku Gakkou-hen"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Black Butler: Public School Edition"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u9ed2\u57f7\u4e8b -\u5bc4\u5bbf\u5b66\u6821\u7de8-"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Black Butler: Public School Arc"}], "title": "Kuroshitsuji: Kishuku Gakkou-hen", "title_english": "Black Butler: Public School Arc", "title_japanese": "\u9ed2\u57f7\u4e8b -\u5bc4\u5bbf\u5b66\u6821\u7de8-", "title_synonyms": ["Black Butler: Public School Edition"], "type": "TV", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 11, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2024-04-13T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2024-06-22T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 13, "month": 4, "year": 2024}, "to": {"day": 22, "month": 6, "year": 2024}}, "string": "Apr 13, 2024 to Jun 22, 2024"}, "duration": "24 min per ep", "rating": "R - 17+ (violence & profanity)", "score": 7.86, "scored_by": 34582, "rank": 938, "popularity": 2271, "members": 101571, "favorites": 736, "synopsis": "At the request of Queen Victoria, Earl Ciel Phantomhive goes to Weston College\u2014a prestigious public academy for boys, known for its traditions and outstanding curriculum\u2014to search for a relative of hers who has not returned home in months.

But if one were to beg hard enough, they just might be lucky enough to get a peek.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 882, "type": "anime", "name": "Toranoana", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/882/Toranoana"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 1882, "type": "anime", "name": "UWAN Pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1882/UWAN_Pictures"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 9, "type": "anime", "name": "Ecchi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/9/Ecchi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 1860, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/1860/Tokyo_Majin_Gakuen_Kenpuuchou__Tou", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1894/113730.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1894/113730t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1894/113730l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1894/113730.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1894/113730t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1894/113730l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "e1cOAM0RiEg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cOAM0RiEg", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/e1cOAM0RiEg?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/e1cOAM0RiEg/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/e1cOAM0RiEg/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/e1cOAM0RiEg/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/e1cOAM0RiEg/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/e1cOAM0RiEg/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Tokyo Majin Gakuen Kenpuuchou: Tou"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u6771\u4eac\u9b54\u4eba\u5b78\u5712\u5263\u98a8\u5e16\u3000\u9f96\uff08\u30c8\u30a6\uff09"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Tokyo Majin"}, {"type": "French", "title": "Tokyo Demon Campus"}], "title": "Tokyo Majin Gakuen Kenpuuchou: Tou", "title_english": "Tokyo Majin", "title_japanese": "\u6771\u4eac\u9b54\u4eba\u5b78\u5712\u5263\u98a8\u5e16\u3000\u9f96\uff08\u30c8\u30a6\uff09", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "TV", "source": "Game", "episodes": 14, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2007-01-19T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2007-04-20T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 19, "month": 1, "year": 2007}, "to": {"day": 20, "month": 4, "year": 2007}}, "string": "Jan 19, 2007 to Apr 20, 2007"}, "duration": "24 min per ep", "rating": "R - 17+ (violence & profanity)", "score": 7.03, "scored_by": 28690, "rank": 4372, "popularity": 2295, "members": 100332, "favorites": 305, "synopsis": "Something evil is stirring in the shadows of Tokyo...\n\nDuring the spring of his senior year in high school, quiet Tatsuma Hiyuu transfers to Magami Academy in Shinjuku. The mysterious boy's \"outsider\" status and his profound skills in martial arts quickly earn him the friendship of class delinquent Kyouichi Houraiji. Through an uncanny connection and a happenstance challenge, he also meets Yuuya Daigo of the wrestling club, the captain of the girls' archery club, Komaki Sakurai, and Aoi Misato, the Student Council President.\n\nDuring their encounter, there is a sudden, harsh disruption of the Ryumyaku (literally Dragon Pulse, otherwise known as Dragon Vein or Dragon Stream), the flow of arcane energy. The surge awakens within the five teenagers a latent power, giving them each a supernatural ability. Enlightened to their newly acquired gifts by Hisui, the young heir of the Kisaragi Clan who maintains his family's antiques shop - as well as their duty to protect Tokyo from Oni (demons) - the Magami students decide to use their power to protect the city from the onslaught of dark forces.\n\nBattling the demons alongside Hisui Kisaragi, the five unlikely friends discover that they may have to face a greater threat to Tokyo other than destroying a few malevolent, random monsters. The Ryumyaku had been disrupted by force, from someone invoking the Dark Arts - and that person has a wicked desire to unleash a long-dead evil.\n\nCan the teenagers overcome their own fears and flaws to fight against the Dark Arts? And soon they will also have to face their own destinies as they discover their Stars of Fate.\n\nThis anime is based on a manga, which was based on the Nintendo role-playing video game originally released in 1998.", "background": "", "season": "winter", "year": 2007, "broadcast": {"day": "Fridays", "time": "23:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Fridays at 23:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 643, "type": "anime", "name": "Trinity Sound", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/643/Trinity_Sound"}, {"mal_id": 2135, "type": "anime", "name": "Imagine", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2135/Imagine"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 97, "type": "anime", "name": "ADV Films", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/97/ADV_Films"}, {"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 83, "type": "anime", "name": "AIC Spirits", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/83/AIC_Spirits"}, {"mal_id": 89, "type": "anime", "name": "BeSTACK", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/89/BeSTACK"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 14, "type": "anime", "name": "Horror", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/14/Horror"}, {"mal_id": 37, "type": "anime", "name": "Supernatural", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 17, "type": "anime", "name": "Martial Arts", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/17/Martial_Arts"}, {"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 22433, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/22433/Break_Blade", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/58635.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/58635t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/58635l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/58635.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/58635t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/58635l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "WlWevyHW2ak", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlWevyHW2ak", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/WlWevyHW2ak?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/WlWevyHW2ak/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/WlWevyHW2ak/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/WlWevyHW2ak/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/WlWevyHW2ak/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/WlWevyHW2ak/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Break Blade"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30af \u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30c9"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Broken Blade"}, {"type": "German", "title": "Broken Blade"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "Broken Blade"}, {"type": "French", "title": "Broken Blade"}], "title": "Break Blade", "title_english": "Broken Blade", "title_japanese": "\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30af \u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30c9", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "TV", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2014-04-06T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2014-06-22T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 6, "month": 4, "year": 2014}, "to": {"day": 22, "month": 6, "year": 2014}}, "string": "Apr 6, 2014 to Jun 22, 2014"}, "duration": "24 min per ep", "rating": "R - 17+ (violence & profanity)", "score": 7.24, "scored_by": 38612, "rank": 3224, "popularity": 2296, "members": 100310, "favorites": 227, "synopsis": "In the continent of Cruzon, an impending war between the Kingdom of Krisna and the nation of Athens is brimming.

Against a roster full of nationally-ranked players, the former flightless crows will have to use everything in their arsenal if they want to represent Miyagi.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Production I.G", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 30, "type": "anime", "name": "Sports", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/30/Sports"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}, {"mal_id": 77, "type": "anime", "name": "Team Sports", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/77/Team_Sports"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]}, {"mal_id": 37407, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/37407/Penguin_Highway", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1320/93443.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1320/93443t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1320/93443l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1320/93443.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1320/93443t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1320/93443l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "prNOowR0Qd8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prNOowR0Qd8", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/prNOowR0Qd8?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/prNOowR0Qd8/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/prNOowR0Qd8/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/prNOowR0Qd8/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/prNOowR0Qd8/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/prNOowR0Qd8/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Penguin Highway"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30da\u30f3\u30ae\u30f3\u30fb\u30cf\u30a4\u30a6\u30a7\u30a4"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "Penguin Highway: El Misterio de los Ping\u00fcinos"}, {"type": "French", "title": "Le Myst\u00e8re des Pingouins"}], "title": "Penguin Highway", "title_english": null, "title_japanese": "\u30da\u30f3\u30ae\u30f3\u30fb\u30cf\u30a4\u30a6\u30a7\u30a4", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "Movie", "source": "Novel", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2018-08-17T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 17, "month": 8, "year": 2018}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Aug 17, 2018"}, "duration": "1 hr 57 min", "rating": "PG - Children", "score": 7.53, "scored_by": 36183, "rank": 1912, "popularity": 2305, "members": 99872, "favorites": 358, "synopsis": "For a child, Aoyama has knowledge comparable to an adult.

Ronald, Draluc, and the vampire's pet armadillo John form quite the eccentric team as they are forced to work together while fending off Ronald's violent editor, the lesser vampires plaguing the city, and even their fellow vampire hunters.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "fall", "year": 2021, "broadcast": {"day": "Mondays", "time": "23:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Mondays at 23:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 61, "type": "anime", "name": "Frontier Works", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/61/Frontier_Works"}, {"mal_id": 82, "type": "anime", "name": "Marvelous Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/82/Marvelous_Entertainment"}, {"mal_id": 144, "type": "anime", "name": "Pony Canyon", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/144/Pony_Canyon"}, {"mal_id": 719, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio Mausu", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/719/Studio_Mausu"}, {"mal_id": 1333, "type": "anime", "name": "Hakuhodo DY Music & Pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1333/Hakuhodo_DY_Music___Pictures"}, {"mal_id": 1373, "type": "anime", "name": "Akita Shoten", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1373/Akita_Shoten"}, {"mal_id": 1416, "type": "anime", "name": "BS11", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1416/BS11"}, {"mal_id": 1551, "type": "anime", "name": "Kadokawa Media House", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1551/Kadokawa_Media_House"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 11, "type": "anime", "name": "Madhouse", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/11/Madhouse"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 50, "type": "anime", "name": "Adult Cast", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"}, {"mal_id": 57, "type": "anime", "name": "Gag Humor", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/57/Gag_Humor"}, {"mal_id": 82, "type": "anime", "name": "Urban Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/82/Urban_Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 32, "type": "anime", "name": "Vampire", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/32/Vampire"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]}, {"mal_id": 1250, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/1250/Erementar_Gerad", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/79163.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/79163t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/79163l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/79163.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/79163t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/79163l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Erementar Gerad"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Erementar Gerade"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30a8\u30ec\u30e1\u30f3\u30bf\u30eb\u30b8\u30a7\u30ec\u30a4\u30c9"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Elemental Gelade"}, {"type": "German", "title": "Elemental Gelade"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "Elemental Gelade"}, {"type": "French", "title": "Elemental Gerad"}], "title": "Erementar Gerad", "title_english": "Elemental Gelade", "title_japanese": "\u30a8\u30ec\u30e1\u30f3\u30bf\u30eb\u30b8\u30a7\u30ec\u30a4\u30c9", "title_synonyms": ["Erementar Gerade"], "type": "TV", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 26, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2005-04-05T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2005-09-27T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 5, "month": 4, "year": 2005}, "to": {"day": 27, "month": 9, "year": 2005}}, "string": "Apr 5, 2005 to Sep 27, 2005"}, "duration": "24 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.23, "scored_by": 45971, "rank": 3299, "popularity": 2316, "members": 99133, "favorites": 464, "synopsis": "After a routine raid, the rookie sky pirate Coud finds a most unusual cargo in his mates' cargo hold: Ren, an \"Edel Reid\", a race prized by humans for granting special combat power to their partners through \"Reacting\".

When Inuyasha's group saves a half-demon child from being hunted by a monstrous creature, they learn that her name is Ai and that she fled from Hourai. Surprisingly, the girl is an acquaintance of Inuyasha and begs him to rescue her friends, who are being held prisoner by vicious demons calling themselves the Four War Gods\u2014an enemy Inuyasha remembers well.\n\nUpon reaching Hourai, Ai's guests are horrified to discover that only a handful of orphans still inhabit the island and are destined to become sacrifices to increase the Four War Gods' powers. Furthermore, the victims bear their oppressors' enchanted mark, which prevents them from escaping. Defeating the four demons remains Inuyasha's most viable option, but their superiority in strength will require daring initiatives achievable only by the group's combined teamwork.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "InuYasha Movie 4: Guren no Houraijima was released shortly after the InuYasha TV series' finale. Unlike the previous movies, the film had the same character designer as the series, resulting in a difference in art style.

The latter was originally broadcasted at the Japanese radio show \"Anime Scramble,\" on December 10 and December 17, 2004. The English DVD was released by Viz Media on August 1, 2006 as both a single disc and one including a cell phone charm and a trading card. A limited-edition version followed on August 15, 2006, containing a lenticular card and an exclusive collector coin.

However, his cover is blown, and the spy reveals himself to be an alien in disguise. Amidst the ensuing chaos, Jirou enlists the aid of cafe waitress and magical girl Kikko Hoshino, one of many \"superhumans\" who blend into society and secretly protect humanity from extraterrestrial threats. As a member of the government agency known as the Super Population Research Laboratory, Jirou has the dual task of protecting superhumans that defend humanity and disposing of any deemed too dangerous to live. Having proven herself a worthy ally, Kikko is invited to join the agency as its newest recruit.\n\nFast forward five years: disapproval and distaste for superhumans are now commonplace in Tokyo. From government corruption and conflicting ideas of justice, to the morality of superhuman rights, the relationship between humans and the supernatural minority balances precariously in a world pervaded by whispers of unrest and unease. Under mysterious circumstances, Jirou has betrayed the agency, and is now a fugitive on the run. As he skulks through the rainy back alleys of Shinjuku, he is pursued by the very same superhumans that he himself once recruited.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Anime Consortium Japan (ACJ) revealed the original production Concrete Revolutio: Choujin Gensou at Anime Expo 2015 in Los Angeles.

Accompanied by his driver who assumes the identity of his sister, Fable is bound by a special condition: he must act as a civilian and not murder anyone lest he and his partner lose their lives.\n\nHowever, the seemingly well-deserved holiday soon takes a grim turn.
