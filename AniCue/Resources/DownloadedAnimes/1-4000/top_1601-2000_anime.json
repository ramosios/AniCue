As the war rages on and the innocent get caught in its destruction, Maria becomes fed up with the situation and begins using her magic to try and prevent further conflict in hopes of maintaining peace. However, her constant intervention soon attracts the attention of the heavens, and the archangel Michael is sent to keep her from meddling in human affairs. The divine being confronts Maria, and he forbids her from using her powers, issuing a decree that her magic will be taken if she loses her virginity. Though she is now labeled a heretic, Maria adamantly refuses to heed Michael's warning and continues to disrupt the war between the two nations. But as the Church begins plotting to take away the witch's power and put a stop to Maria's interference once and for all, her peacemaking may soon come to an end.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Episode 1 was previewed at Bandai Channel on January 4, 2015.

Therefore, rather than just bringing the Kagamidai boys into the Yuihime girls' school all at once, a plan is concocted in which a group of test males will be inserted into the Girls' Private Academy first.\n\nThus, poor young Shingo finds himself being thrown as a sacrificial lamb to the lionesses of Yuihime, who aren't exactly waiting for him with open arms. Will Shingo manage to survive the estrogen soaked death pit that is Yuihime? Can the girls learn to be more receptive to the boys? And just how long until something involving panties will cause emotions to flare, sparks to fly and the battle of the sexes to explode?\n\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks, edited)", "background": "", "season": "fall", "year": 2011, "broadcast": {"day": "Wednesdays", "time": "02:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Wednesdays at 02:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 61, "type": "anime", "name": "Frontier Works", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/61/Frontier_Works"}, {"mal_id": 104, "type": "anime", "name": "Lantis", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/104/Lantis"}, {"mal_id": 108, "type": "anime", "name": "Media Factory", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/108/Media_Factory"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 376, "type": "anime", "name": "Sentai Filmworks", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 32, "type": "anime", "name": "Manglobe", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/32/Manglobe"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 35, "type": "anime", "name": "Harem", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/35/Harem"}, {"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 36817, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/36817/Sunohara-sou_no_Kanrinin-san", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1539/124746.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1539/124746t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1539/124746l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1539/124746.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1539/124746t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1539/124746l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "jCPj1qQYVls", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCPj1qQYVls", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/jCPj1qQYVls?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/jCPj1qQYVls/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/jCPj1qQYVls/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/jCPj1qQYVls/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/jCPj1qQYVls/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/jCPj1qQYVls/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Sunohara-sou no Kanrinin-san"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u3059\u306e\u306f\u3089\u8358\u306e\u7ba1\u7406\u4eba\u3055\u3093"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Miss Caretaker of Sunohara-sou"}], "title": "Sunohara-sou no Kanrinin-san", "title_english": "Miss Caretaker of Sunohara-sou", "title_japanese": "\u3059\u306e\u306f\u3089\u8358\u306e\u7ba1\u7406\u4eba\u3055\u3093", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "TV", "source": "4-koma manga", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2018-07-05T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2018-09-20T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 5, "month": 7, "year": 2018}, "to": {"day": 20, "month": 9, "year": 2018}}, "string": "Jul 5, 2018 to Sep 20, 2018"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 6.73, "scored_by": 61402, "rank": 5872, "popularity": 1612, "members": 160718, "favorites": 449, "synopsis": "Aki Shiina has always been perceived as a girl because of his feminine appearance.

Ron's situation changes drastically when police detective Totomaru Isshiki, following the advice of a senior colleague, seeks him out for help with a criminal case that has remained unsolved for months. Ron reluctantly agrees to help Totomaru and uses his phenomenal intuition to discover the culprit in less than a day.

As the concertgoers evacuate, a young girl named Ranka Lee is left behind and gets targeted by the Vajra, but she is saved at the last minute by Alto. Following these events, the Strategic Military Services program notes Alto's skill in battle, resulting in his recruitment to combat the new alien threat.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Winner of the 2009 Seiun Award for Best Dramatic Presentation.", "season": "spring", "year": 2008, "broadcast": {"day": "Fridays", "time": "01:25", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Fridays at 01:25 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai Visual", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/23/Bandai_Visual"}, {"mal_id": 143, "type": "anime", "name": "Mainichi Broadcasting System", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"}, {"mal_id": 351, "type": "anime", "name": "Big West", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/351/Big_West"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 217, "type": "anime", "name": "Nozomi Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/217/Nozomi_Entertainment"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 41, "type": "anime", "name": "Satelight", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/41/Satelight"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 46, "type": "anime", "name": "Award Winning", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/46/Award_Winning"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 18, "type": "anime", "name": "Mecha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}, {"mal_id": 38, "type": "anime", "name": "Military", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"}, {"mal_id": 19, "type": "anime", "name": "Music", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/19/Music"}, {"mal_id": 29, "type": "anime", "name": "Space", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/29/Space"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 34102, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/34102/Sakurada_Reset", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/87743.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/87743t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/87743l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/87743.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/87743t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/87743l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "NkckJHZqKE4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkckJHZqKE4", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/NkckJHZqKE4?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/NkckJHZqKE4/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/NkckJHZqKE4/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/NkckJHZqKE4/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/NkckJHZqKE4/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/NkckJHZqKE4/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Sakurada Reset"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30b5\u30af\u30e9\u30c0\u30ea\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Sagrada Reset"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "Sagrada Reset"}], "title": "Sakurada Reset", "title_english": "Sagrada Reset", "title_japanese": "\u30b5\u30af\u30e9\u30c0\u30ea\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "TV", "source": "Light novel", "episodes": 24, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2017-04-05T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2017-09-13T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 5, "month": 4, "year": 2017}, "to": {"day": 13, "month": 9, "year": 2017}}, "string": "Apr 5, 2017 to Sep 13, 2017"}, "duration": "25 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.33, "scored_by": 44357, "rank": 2767, "popularity": 1668, "members": 152898, "favorites": 621, "synopsis": "Kei Asai lives in the oceanside city of Sakurada\u2014a town where the inhabitants are born with strange abilities.

To convince her to fulfill her duties, one of her attendants, Judith Snorrevik, goes to the human realm to find a human male whom Lotte can tolerate.\n\nJudith returns with 23-year-old Naoya Touhara, a single father who unfortunately leaves his daughter, Asuha, behind in the human realm.

Seventeen years later, their pursuit is still growing in both size and brutality. Unbeknownst to the citizens, the targets of these witch hunts are the secret protectors of humanity. Known as the Makai Knights and Alchemists, they have a strong will to protect people from Horrors, demons who possess souls plagued by sadness and pain.\n\nOne such Makai Knight is 17-year-old Leon Luis who inherits the legendary armor of the Golden Knight Garo from his mother. Though he possesses great power, he struggles to overcome the hatred he bears from his mother's death at the hands of the kingdom. His father German, known as Zoro the Shadow Cutting Knight, is still training Leon when he is called to investigate the upsurge of Horrors in the kingdom's capital. Although German knows Leon's will is wavering, he decides to bring Leon along to continue his training.\n\nAs German and Leon head to the capital, the king's amiable son Alfonso San Valiante struggles to find a solution to the growing Horror threat. But before he can do so, he is double-crossed and banished from his own kingdom. To return home, Alfonso sets out to find the help and strength he needs to reclaim the throne. During his search, he comes across Leon, whose interactions with the prince will forever change both of their fates.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Garo: Honoo no Kokuin is inspired by Garo Tokusatsu and is one of the few Tokusatsu franchises adapted into an animated work.", "season": "fall", "year": 2014, "broadcast": {"day": "Saturdays", "time": "01:23", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Saturdays at 01:23 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 577, "type": "anime", "name": "Tohokushinsha Film Corporation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/577/Tohokushinsha_Film_Corporation"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 569, "type": "anime", "name": "MAPPA", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/569/MAPPA"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 4472, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/4472/Lucky\u2606Star__Original_na_Visual_to_Animation", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1475/99189.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1475/99189t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1475/99189l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1475/99189.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1475/99189t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1475/99189l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "nlYreOHHy_4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlYreOHHy_4", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/nlYreOHHy_4?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/nlYreOHHy_4/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/nlYreOHHy_4/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/nlYreOHHy_4/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/nlYreOHHy_4/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/nlYreOHHy_4/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Lucky\u2606Star: Original na Visual to Animation"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Lucky Star OVA"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u3089\u304d\u2606\u3059\u305f OVA\uff08\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u306a\u30d3\u30b8\u30e5\u30a2\u30eb\u3068\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\uff09"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Lucky\u2606Star OVA"}], "title": "Lucky\u2606Star: Original na Visual to Animation", "title_english": "Lucky\u2606Star OVA", "title_japanese": "\u3089\u304d\u2606\u3059\u305f OVA\uff08\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u306a\u30d3\u30b8\u30e5\u30a2\u30eb\u3068\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\uff09", "title_synonyms": ["Lucky Star OVA"], "type": "OVA", "source": "4-koma manga", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2008-09-26T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 26, "month": 9, "year": 2008}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Sep 26, 2008"}, "duration": "42 min", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.8, "scored_by": 91776, "rank": 1073, "popularity": 1695, "members": 149808, "favorites": 223, "synopsis": "The OVA features six separate stories revolving around the cast, some of which border on the bizarre;

She soon meets the other residents: Tsubasa Katsuki, a shounen manga artist; Ruki Irokawa, who draws erotic manga popular with women; and Koyume Koizuka, a shoujo artist who, like Chaos, has yet to be serialized.

Amid holding off the invading forces, the Parsian army is met by an unexpected visitor.\n\nAs Arslan returns to Peshawar, Prince Hermes takes a slight detour from his clash against his cousin to search for the legendary sword Rukhnabad, which would grant him the right to rule and take back what he believes is rightfully his. However, after unearthing the lost artifact, the blade is stolen by the Temple Knights of Lusitania, prompting the masked warrior to give chase. Meanwhile in Ecbatana, the captive King Andragoras III finds an opportunity to strike and begins to make his move.\n\nAs the separate sides of the Parsian royal conflict clash, Arslan's right to the throne falls under attack.

Due to his animal handling skills and former experience as a jouster, this makes him a hot commodity. Multiple beautiful girls in the school want him to become their personal begleiter, though Takahiro always refuses their offers.\n\nOne day a bizarre accident causes his friend, Mio Kisaski, to be challenged to a jousting duel despite her not actually being a knight.

After 15 years of fruitlessly seeking a way to lift the spell, Oscar resorts to enlisting the help of a different witch. To this end, he heads to the Azure Tower, home of the Witch of the Azure Moon. Ascending the tower is no easy task; for decades, no one has overcome the array of traps, puzzles, and enemies designed to repulse any challengers. Oscar, however, easily climbs to the top, where he meets the fabled witch, Tinasha. To the prince's surprise, despite being hundreds of years old, Tinasha looks like a beautiful young woman in her late teens.\n\nOscar explains his circumstances to the witch, who quickly perceives the true nature of his affliction. Though she claims that undoing the spell would be tremendously difficult, Tinasha proposes a workaround\u2014to find Oscar a partner capable of withstanding the curse's effects.\n\nRealizing that such a woman is right in front of his eyes, Oscar boldly tells the witch to marry him. Though he is promptly rejected, the young prince refuses to back down, and the two eventually reach an agreement: Tinasha will leave the tower and live with Oscar for the next year. As the two continue searching for a way to lift Oscar's curse, word of Tinasha's emergence from isolation spreads, catching the attention of all sorts of old acquaintances.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Unnamed Memory was initially scheduled to air in 2023 but was delayed due to production reasons.

As they revisit the memories of their young love, the romance between them is rekindled, inspiring similar feelings in the younger members of their family.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 2024, "broadcast": {"day": "Sundays", "time": "23:30", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Sundays at 23:30 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 238, "type": "anime", "name": "AT-X", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"}, {"mal_id": 323, "type": "anime", "name": "Nippon Columbia", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/323/Nippon_Columbia"}, {"mal_id": 1600, "type": "anime", "name": "On-Lead", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1600/On-Lead"}, {"mal_id": 1696, "type": "anime", "name": "Kadokawa", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 2554, "type": "anime", "name": "Gekkou", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2554/Gekkou"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}, {"mal_id": 37, "type": "anime", "name": "Supernatural", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 51837, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/51837/Saikin_Yatotta_Maid_ga_Ayashii", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1022/123845.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1022/123845t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1022/123845l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1022/123845.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1022/123845t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1022/123845l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "wxT61uWZlYs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxT61uWZlYs", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/wxT61uWZlYs?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/wxT61uWZlYs/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/wxT61uWZlYs/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/wxT61uWZlYs/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/wxT61uWZlYs/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/wxT61uWZlYs/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Saikin Yatotta Maid ga Ayashii"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "My Recently Hired Maid is Suspicious"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u6700\u8fd1\u96c7\u3063\u305f\u30e1\u30a4\u30c9\u304c\u602a\u3057\u3044"}, {"type": "English", "title": "The Maid I Hired Recently Is Mysterious"}], "title": "Saikin Yatotta Maid ga Ayashii", "title_english": "The Maid I Hired Recently Is Mysterious", "title_japanese": "\u6700\u8fd1\u96c7\u3063\u305f\u30e1\u30a4\u30c9\u304c\u602a\u3057\u3044", "title_synonyms": ["My Recently Hired Maid is Suspicious"], "type": "TV", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 11, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2022-07-24T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2022-10-09T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 24, "month": 7, "year": 2022}, "to": {"day": 9, "month": 10, "year": 2022}}, "string": "Jul 24, 2022 to Oct 9, 2022"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 6.57, "scored_by": 44912, "rank": 6792, "popularity": 1783, "members": 140802, "favorites": 524, "synopsis": "The maid Lilith, hired to look after young Yuuri and his family's mansion, seems highly suspicious: she is too good to be true.

Now she is expected to marry a nobleman and live as a refined housewife without disgracing her family name. Reluctant to accept her fate, the headstrong Arte steps into the streets in search of a master artisan to take her on as an apprentice.\n\nIn her quest for a mentor, Arte has to face harsh reality when she is completely shunned for being a female artist. No one believes that women are capable of fine craftsmanship, and therefore none are willing to accept her. Luckily, a renowned artisan by the name of Leo is persuaded to take her as his disciple since he has none anyway. And thus, Arte's new life begins, far from the comfort of her noble upbringing. As an apprentice, she must earn her keep while tackling various challenges along the difficult path to becoming a full-fledged, master artisan.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 2020, "broadcast": {"day": "Saturdays", "time": "22:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Saturdays at 22:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 135, "type": "anime", "name": "MediaNet", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/135/MediaNet"}, {"mal_id": 141, "type": "anime", "name": "Toei Video", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/141/Toei_Video"}, {"mal_id": 460, "type": "anime", "name": "KlockWorx", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/460/KlockWorx"}, {"mal_id": 464, "type": "anime", "name": "flying DOG", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/464/flying_DOG"}, {"mal_id": 513, "type": "anime", "name": "Nikkatsu", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/513/Nikkatsu"}, {"mal_id": 517, "type": "anime", "name": "Asmik Ace", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/517/Asmik_Ace"}, {"mal_id": 843, "type": "anime", "name": "BS Fuji", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/843/BS_Fuji"}, {"mal_id": 1113, "type": "anime", "name": "NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1113/NBCUniversal_Entertainment_Japan"}, {"mal_id": 1211, "type": "anime", "name": "Tokyo MX", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1211/Tokyo_MX"}, {"mal_id": 1255, "type": "anime", "name": "Glovision", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1255/Glovision"}, {"mal_id": 1534, "type": "anime", "name": "North Stars Pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1534/North_Stars_Pictures"}, {"mal_id": 1581, "type": "anime", "name": "RAY", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1581/RAY"}, {"mal_id": 1786, "type": "anime", "name": "Muse Communication", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1786/Muse_Communication"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 35, "type": "anime", "name": "Seven Arcs", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/35/Seven_Arcs"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 13, "type": "anime", "name": "Historical", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}, {"mal_id": 80, "type": "anime", "name": "Visual Arts", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/80/Visual_Arts"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 42, "type": "anime", "name": "Seinen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]}, {"mal_id": 34414, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/34414/Nanbaka_2", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1294/127370.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1294/127370t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1294/127370l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1294/127370.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1294/127370t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1294/127370l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "sN_pg69cLAI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN_pg69cLAI", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/sN_pg69cLAI?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/sN_pg69cLAI/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/sN_pg69cLAI/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/sN_pg69cLAI/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/sN_pg69cLAI/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/sN_pg69cLAI/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Nanbaka 2"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30ca\u30f3\u30d0\u30ab 2\u671f"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Nanbaka Season 2"}, {"type": "German", "title": "Nanbaka Staffel 2"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "Nanbaka Temporada 2"}, {"type": "French", "title": "Nanbaka Saison 2"}], "title": "Nanbaka 2", "title_english": "Nanbaka Season 2", "title_japanese": "\u30ca\u30f3\u30d0\u30ab 2\u671f", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "ONA", "source": "Web manga", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2017-01-04T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2017-03-22T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 4, "month": 1, "year": 2017}, "to": {"day": 22, "month": 3, "year": 2017}}, "string": "Jan 4, 2017 to Mar 22, 2017"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.49, "scored_by": 69168, "rank": 2077, "popularity": 1785, "members": 140738, "favorites": 397, "synopsis": "The second part of Nanbaka.

Jashin-chan is also often visited by her demon friends: the kindhearted Gorgon Medusa and the energetic minotaur Minosu, who seem much more well-behaved in contrast, and disapprove of her plans to kill Yurine.\n\nJashin-chan Dropkick is a comedy focusing on these two reluctant roommates and their bizarre antics as they get by with their cat-and-mouse relationship.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "summer", "year": 2018, "broadcast": {"day": "Tuesdays", "time": "01:05", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Tuesdays at 01:05 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 843, "type": "anime", "name": "BS Fuji", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/843/BS_Fuji"}, {"mal_id": 884, "type": "anime", "name": "Strawberry Meets Pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/884/Strawberry_Meets_Pictures"}, {"mal_id": 1221, "type": "anime", "name": "Hokkaido Cultural Broadcasting", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1221/Hokkaido_Cultural_Broadcasting"}, {"mal_id": 1677, "type": "anime", "name": "Kanetsu Investment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1677/Kanetsu_Investment"}, {"mal_id": 2092, "type": "anime", "name": "BookLive", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2092/BookLive"}, {"mal_id": 2093, "type": "anime", "name": "ibis Capital Partners", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2093/ibis_Capital_Partners"}, {"mal_id": 2095, "type": "anime", "name": "Global Solutions", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2095/Global_Solutions"}, {"mal_id": 2096, "type": "anime", "name": "Y&N Brothers", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2096/Y_N_Brothers"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 70, "type": "anime", "name": "Nomad", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/70/Nomad"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 37, "type": "anime", "name": "Supernatural", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 57, "type": "anime", "name": "Gag Humor", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/57/Gag_Humor"}, {"mal_id": 6, "type": "anime", "name": "Mythology", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/6/Mythology"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 8426, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/8426/Hourou_Musuko", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/53945.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/53945t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/53945l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/53945.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/53945t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/53945l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "RG2JiRohtmQ", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RG2JiRohtmQ", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/RG2JiRohtmQ?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/RG2JiRohtmQ/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/RG2JiRohtmQ/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/RG2JiRohtmQ/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/RG2JiRohtmQ/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/RG2JiRohtmQ/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Hourou Musuko"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "The Transient Son"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u653e\u6d6a\u606f\u5b50"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Wandering Son"}, {"type": "German", "title": "Hourou Musuko: Wondering son"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "Wandering Son (Hourou Musuko)"}, {"type": "French", "title": "Hourou Musuko: Wondering son"}], "title": "Hourou Musuko", "title_english": "Wandering Son", "title_japanese": "\u653e\u6d6a\u606f\u5b50", "title_synonyms": ["The Transient Son"], "type": "TV", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 11, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2011-01-14T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2011-04-01T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 14, "month": 1, "year": 2011}, "to": {"day": 1, "month": 4, "year": 2011}}, "string": "Jan 14, 2011 to Apr 1, 2011"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.68, "scored_by": 43250, "rank": 1404, "popularity": 1847, "members": 135287, "favorites": 1092, "synopsis": "Effeminate fifth grader Shuuichi Nitori is considered by most to be one of the prettiest girls in school, but much to her dismay, she is actually biologically male.

Unfortunately for her, the party's eagle-eyed leader, Jade Scrade, deduces her identity, jeopardizing the receptionist's dream of a carefree life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "winter", "year": 2025, "broadcast": {"day": "Saturdays", "time": "00:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Saturdays at 00:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 17, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"}, {"mal_id": 166, "type": "anime", "name": "Movic", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"}, {"mal_id": 213, "type": "anime", "name": "Half H.P Studio", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/213/Half_HP_Studio"}, {"mal_id": 1261, "type": "anime", "name": "Good Smile Company", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1261/Good_Smile_Company"}, {"mal_id": 1416, "type": "anime", "name": "BS11", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1416/BS11"}, {"mal_id": 1696, "type": "anime", "name": "Kadokawa", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 1835, "type": "anime", "name": "CloverWorks", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1835/CloverWorks"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 18497, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/18497/Yozakura_Quartet__Hana_no_Uta", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/52563.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/52563t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/52563l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/52563.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/52563t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/52563l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "me1ya1EFzsc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me1ya1EFzsc", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/me1ya1EFzsc?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/me1ya1EFzsc/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/me1ya1EFzsc/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/me1ya1EFzsc/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/me1ya1EFzsc/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/me1ya1EFzsc/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Yozakura Quartet: Hana no Uta"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u591c\u685c\u56db\u91cd\u594f \uff5e\u30cf\u30ca\u30ce\u30a6\u30bf\uff5e"}], "title": "Yozakura Quartet: Hana no Uta", "title_english": null, "title_japanese": "\u591c\u685c\u56db\u91cd\u594f \uff5e\u30cf\u30ca\u30ce\u30a6\u30bf\uff5e", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "TV", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 13, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2013-10-06T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2013-12-29T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 6, "month": 10, "year": 2013}, "to": {"day": 29, "month": 12, "year": 2013}}, "string": "Oct 6, 2013 to Dec 29, 2013"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.44, "scored_by": 38540, "rank": 2255, "popularity": 1902, "members": 130497, "favorites": 442, "synopsis": "Hundreds of years ago, the borders between the worlds of humans and youkai temporarily overlapped, resulting in many residents of both crossing over to the other side.

This office is composed of Hime Yarizakura, the young mayor of the city; satori Ao Nanami, who can read people's minds; half-youkai Kotoha Isone, who can summon anything by speaking a word; oni siblings, Kyousuke and Touka Kishi; and the office director Akina Hiizumi, who inherited his family's ability to force youkai back to their world.\n\nBesides volunteer and arbitration work, the Life Counseling Office also suppresses any Strikes: rare occurrences where humans are suddenly infused with youkai powers and go on a rampage. But the appearance of a sinister man signals trouble as Strikes become increasingly common, political rivals make their moves, and malicious individuals descend upon the city. As the self-appointed defenders of Sakurashin, it's up to the Life Counseling Office to protect the idyllic city they call home!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Episode 1 was previewed at a screening in Tokyo on September 28, 2013.

There is, however, a minimum size requirement to be a pro sumo wrestler, and young Hinomaru Ushio, incredibly talented and hardworking though he may be, does not meet that requirement. This small boy has big dreams of reaching the highest class of  sumo, Hinoshita Kaisan. The only way he could possibly go pro is if he becomes the High School Yokozuna, a title given to the strongest wrestler in high school tournaments.\n\nUshio is under a lot of pressure, as well as a time limit. If he can't show off his skills in the high school tournaments, he may lose his chance to go pro permanently, and the odds are stacked against him. Instead of enrolling in Ishigami High, the best school for sumo in Japan, he enrolls in Odachi High and must build a sumo club from the ground up with the one devout member Shinya Ozeki. Odachi High is the true underdog of the sumo world, but Ushio has to push forward with all his strength if he is going to make it professionally.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "fall", "year": 2018, "broadcast": {"day": "Fridays", "time": "22:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Fridays at 22:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 139, "type": "anime", "name": "Nihon Ad Systems", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/139/Nihon_Ad_Systems"}, {"mal_id": 144, "type": "anime", "name": "Pony Canyon", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/144/Pony_Canyon"}, {"mal_id": 1365, "type": "anime", "name": "Shueisha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1365/Shueisha"}, {"mal_id": 1416, "type": "anime", "name": "BS11", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1416/BS11"}, {"mal_id": 1517, "type": "anime", "name": "Jinnan Studio", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1517/Jinnan_Studio"}, {"mal_id": 1587, "type": "anime", "name": "Cygames", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1587/Cygames"}, {"mal_id": 1901, "type": "anime", "name": "CA-Cygames Anime Fund", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1901/CA-Cygames_Anime_Fund"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 3, "type": "anime", "name": "Gonzo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/3/Gonzo"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 30, "type": "anime", "name": "Sports", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/30/Sports"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 54, "type": "anime", "name": "Combat Sports", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/54/Combat_Sports"}, {"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]}, {"mal_id": 7465, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/7465/Eve_no_Jikan_Movie", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/27711.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/27711t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/27711l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/27711.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/27711t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/27711l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "iVsFcMt_ivI", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVsFcMt_ivI", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/iVsFcMt_ivI?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/iVsFcMt_ivI/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/iVsFcMt_ivI/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/iVsFcMt_ivI/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/iVsFcMt_ivI/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/iVsFcMt_ivI/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Eve no Jikan (Movie)"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Eve's Time"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Eve no Jikan 1st Season Complete Edition"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Gekijouban Eve no Jikan"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30a4\u30f4\u306e\u6642\u9593"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Time of Eve"}, {"type": "German", "title": "Time of Eve: The Movie"}], "title": "Eve no Jikan (Movie)", "title_english": "Time of Eve", "title_japanese": "\u30a4\u30f4\u306e\u6642\u9593", "title_synonyms": ["Eve's Time", "Eve no Jikan 1st Season Complete Edition", "Gekijouban Eve no Jikan"], "type": "Movie", "source": "Original", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2010-03-06T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 6, "month": 3, "year": 2010}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Mar 6, 2010"}, "duration": "1 hr 46 min", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.95, "scored_by": 57710, "rank": 763, "popularity": 1914, "members": 129177, "favorites": 589, "synopsis": "In the Japan of the future, employing androids for various purposes is nothing out of the ordinary.

Though Hotaru rejects him, Hananoi insists on letting her get to know him. He does whatever he can to woo her, from changing his hairstyle to finding her lost hairpin in the snow.\n\nAlthough she has no romantic feelings towards him, Hotaru believes that by spending more time with him, she will learn how to love. She agrees to date him and slowly begins to navigate what being a girlfriend entails, including how to reciprocate the kind gestures that Hananoi continues to perform for her.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 2024, "broadcast": {"day": "Thursdays", "time": "23:56", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Thursdays at 23:56 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 145, "type": "anime", "name": "TBS", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/145/TBS"}, {"mal_id": 159, "type": "anime", "name": "Kodansha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"}, {"mal_id": 1261, "type": "anime", "name": "Good Smile Company", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1261/Good_Smile_Company"}, {"mal_id": 1468, "type": "anime", "name": "Crunchyroll", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1468/Crunchyroll"}, {"mal_id": 1542, "type": "anime", "name": "DMM.com", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1542/DMMcom"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 2455, "type": "anime", "name": "East Fish Studio", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2455/East_Fish_Studio"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 25, "type": "anime", "name": "Shoujo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo"}]}, {"mal_id": 37932, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/37932/Quanzhi_Gaoshou_2", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1573/109220.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1573/109220t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1573/109220l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1573/109220.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1573/109220t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1573/109220l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "p77_1BmuIOg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p77_1BmuIOg", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/p77_1BmuIOg?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/p77_1BmuIOg/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/p77_1BmuIOg/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/p77_1BmuIOg/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/p77_1BmuIOg/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/p77_1BmuIOg/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Quanzhi Gaoshou 2"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Quan Zhi Gao Shou 2nd Season"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Full-Time Expert 2nd Season"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Master of Skills 2nd Season"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30aa\u30d6\u30b9\u30ad\u30eb 2\u671f"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u5168\u804c\u9ad8\u624b2"}, {"type": "English", "title": "The King's Avatar 2"}], "title": "Quanzhi Gaoshou 2", "title_english": "The King's Avatar 2", "title_japanese": "\u5168\u804c\u9ad8\u624b2", "title_synonyms": ["Quan Zhi Gao Shou 2nd Season", "Full-Time Expert 2nd Season", "Master of Skills 2nd Season", "\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30aa\u30d6\u30b9\u30ad\u30eb 2\u671f"], "type": "ONA", "source": "Web novel", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2020-09-25T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2020-12-04T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 25, "month": 9, "year": 2020}, "to": {"day": 4, "month": 12, "year": 2020}}, "string": "Sep 25, 2020 to Dec 4, 2020"}, "duration": "24 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.91, "scored_by": 47848, "rank": 849, "popularity": 1932, "members": 127400, "favorites": 563, "synopsis": "The \"Unspecialized\" character Lord Grim is infamous in the 10th server of the popular online game Glory.

Together with her best friends Manana Nonomura and Yuki Hosokawa, Chio will do whatever it takes to avoid her school's harsh penalties for tardiness.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "summer", "year": 2018, "broadcast": {"day": "Fridays", "time": "22:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Fridays at 22:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 51, "type": "anime", "name": "Diomed\u00e9a", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/51/Diomed%C3%A9a"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 42, "type": "anime", "name": "Seinen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]}, {"mal_id": 31914, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/31914/Shoujo-tachi_wa_Kouya_wo_Mezasu", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/77837.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/77837t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/77837l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/77837.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/77837t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/77837l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "rblaPG33Hnk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rblaPG33Hnk", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/rblaPG33Hnk?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/rblaPG33Hnk/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/rblaPG33Hnk/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/rblaPG33Hnk/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/rblaPG33Hnk/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/rblaPG33Hnk/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Shoujo-tachi wa Kouya wo Mezasu"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "The girls who aim for the wildlands"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Girls beyond the youth KOYA"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Shokomeza"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u5c11\u5973\u305f\u3061\u306f\u8352\u91ce\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3059"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Girls Beyond the Wasteland"}, {"type": "German", "title": "Girls Beyond the Wasteland"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "Girls Beyond The Wasteland"}, {"type": "French", "title": "Girls Beyond the Wasteland"}], "title": "Shoujo-tachi wa Kouya wo Mezasu", "title_english": "Girls Beyond the Wasteland", "title_japanese": "\u5c11\u5973\u305f\u3061\u306f\u8352\u91ce\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3059", "title_synonyms": ["The girls who aim for the wildlands", "Girls beyond the youth KOYA", "Shokomeza"], "type": "TV", "source": "Visual novel", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2016-01-07T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2016-03-24T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 7, "month": 1, "year": 2016}, "to": {"day": 24, "month": 3, "year": 2016}}, "string": "Jan 7, 2016 to Mar 24, 2016"}, "duration": "24 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 6.3, "scored_by": 45732, "rank": 8432, "popularity": 1950, "members": 126141, "favorites": 175, "synopsis": "Shoujo-tachi wa Kouya wo Mezasu is a series all about finding oneself and a direction in life... no matter how far off the beaten path it might be. \n\nBuntarou Hojo is a high school student who has a talent for writing, but no real direction in life or any plans for the future.
