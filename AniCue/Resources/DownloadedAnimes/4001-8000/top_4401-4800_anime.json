After locating the ring's owner, Kanon Miyamori, they learn that Kanon had tossed it into the sea after her boyfriend dumped her earlier that day.\n\nThough Marin insists that such a lovely item should not be thrown away, Kanon discards it once again. As they search for the ring, Urin becomes separated from the other two and accidently breaks the seal on a stone coffin, releasing an evil being known as Sedna. Sensing Sedna's release, the formerly missing turtle elder, Matsumoto, reveals himself to Kanon and her companions, naming Marin as the Priestess of the Sea. Together with the Priestess of the Sky, she has the power to seal Sedna away again. And as luck would have it, during an encounter with one of Sedna's minions, Kanon discovers that she is the Priestess of the Sky. Though Kanon is hesitant, she and Marin decide to work together to save the world from the evil that threatens it.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "summer", "year": 2009, "broadcast": {"day": "Thursdays", "time": "01:29", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Thursdays at 01:29 (JST)"}, "producers": [], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 217, "type": "anime", "name": "Nozomi Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/217/Nozomi_Entertainment"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 218, "type": "anime", "name": "Zexcs", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/218/Zexcs"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 38005, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/38005/Strike_Witches__Road_to_Berlin", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1197/108577.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1197/108577t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1197/108577l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1197/108577.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1197/108577t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1197/108577l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "SfWwKwgsizo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfWwKwgsizo", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/SfWwKwgsizo?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/SfWwKwgsizo/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/SfWwKwgsizo/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/SfWwKwgsizo/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/SfWwKwgsizo/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/SfWwKwgsizo/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Strike Witches: Road to Berlin"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Strike Witches 3"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u7b2c501\u7d71\u5408\u6226\u95d8\u822a\u7a7a\u56e3 \u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30af\u30a6\u30a3\u30c3\u30c1\u30fc\u30ba ROAD to BERLIN"}, {"type": "French", "title": "501st Joint Fighter Wing Strike Witches: Road to Berlin"}], "title": "Strike Witches: Road to Berlin", "title_english": null, "title_japanese": "\u7b2c501\u7d71\u5408\u6226\u95d8\u822a\u7a7a\u56e3 \u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30af\u30a6\u30a3\u30c3\u30c1\u30fc\u30ba ROAD to BERLIN", "title_synonyms": ["Strike Witches 3"], "type": "TV", "source": "Original", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2020-10-08T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2020-12-24T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 8, "month": 10, "year": 2020}, "to": {"day": 24, "month": 12, "year": 2020}}, "string": "Oct 8, 2020 to Dec 24, 2020"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.35, "scored_by": 8933, "rank": 2630, "popularity": 4412, "members": 30602, "favorites": 100, "synopsis": "Preparations for a new offensive against the Neuroi\u2014a mysterious race of alien invaders\u2014are well underway.

He's saved by a mysterious girl named Eimu Yoake, who also has strange powers.\n\nEimu reveals that his powers stem from a creature known as an Ayakashi, a parasitic being that grants the user special abilities at the price of slowly draining the life of the host. She helps him fully awaken his own. Now aware of the ayakashi he possesses, Yuu must live up to his childhood vow, putting his ayakashi to use and fend off those who would use their own for evil, all while unraveling the mystery behind the death of his friend.", "background": "", "season": "winter", "year": 2008, "broadcast": {"day": "Wednesdays", "time": "11:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Wednesdays at 11:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 108, "type": "anime", "name": "Media Factory", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/108/Media_Factory"}, {"mal_id": 238, "type": "anime", "name": "AT-X", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"}, {"mal_id": 311, "type": "anime", "name": "Enoki Films", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/311/Enoki_Films"}, {"mal_id": 1425, "type": "anime", "name": "5pb.", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1425/5pb"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 467, "type": "anime", "name": "Discotek Media", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/467/Discotek_Media"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 122, "type": "anime", "name": "Tokyo Kids", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/122/Tokyo_Kids"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 14, "type": "anime", "name": "Horror", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/14/Horror"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 58, "type": "anime", "name": "Gore", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/58/Gore"}, {"mal_id": 31, "type": "anime", "name": "Super Power", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/31/Super_Power"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 39991, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/39991/Promare__Galo-hen", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1369/108826.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1369/108826t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1369/108826l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1369/108826.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1369/108826t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1369/108826l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Promare: Galo-hen"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "PROMARE\uff08\u30d7\u30ed\u30e1\u30a2\uff09\u30ac\u30ed\u7de8"}], "title": "Promare: Galo-hen", "title_english": null, "title_japanese": "PROMARE\uff08\u30d7\u30ed\u30e1\u30a2\uff09\u30ac\u30ed\u7de8", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "ONA", "source": "Original", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2019-05-24T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 24, "month": 5, "year": 2019}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "May 24, 2019"}, "duration": "10 min", "rating": "PG-13 -

Not all is well, however, as Kashima fears that magic is all that he has and Toyohi is only in love with Kashima the Wizard.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "winter", "year": 2016, "broadcast": {"day": "Fridays", "time": "23:17", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Fridays at 23:17 (JST)"}, "producers": [], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 2385, "type": "anime", "name": "Kuma Holdings", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2385/Kuma_Holdings"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 291, "type": "anime", "name": "CoMix Wave Films", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/291/CoMix_Wave_Films"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 28, "type": "anime", "name": "Boys Love", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/28/Boys_Love"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 38920, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/38920/Kochouki__Wakaki_Nobunaga", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1934/111399.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1934/111399t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1934/111399l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1934/111399.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1934/111399t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1934/111399l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "WoUVEFxra7w", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoUVEFxra7w", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/WoUVEFxra7w?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/WoUVEFxra7w/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/WoUVEFxra7w/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/WoUVEFxra7w/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/WoUVEFxra7w/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/WoUVEFxra7w/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Kochouki: Wakaki Nobunaga"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Gorgeous Butterfly: Young Nobunaga"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u80e1\u8776\u7dba \uff5e\u82e5\u304d\u4fe1\u9577\uff5e"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Kochoki"}], "title": "Kochouki: Wakaki Nobunaga", "title_english": "Kochoki", "title_japanese": "\u80e1\u8776\u7dba \uff5e\u82e5\u304d\u4fe1\u9577\uff5e", "title_synonyms": ["Gorgeous Butterfly: Young Nobunaga"], "type": "TV", "source": "Original", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2019-07-08T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2019-09-23T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 8, "month": 7, "year": 2019}, "to": {"day": 23, "month": 9, "year": 2019}}, "string": "Jul 8, 2019 to Sep 23, 2019"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 6.51, "scored_by": 9500, "rank": 7177, "popularity": 4424, "members": 30398, "favorites": 58, "synopsis": "The fearsome warlord, the demonic king\u2014Oda Nobunaga!

Fifty years have passed since mankind developed the Network society. It was anticipated that this new infrastructure would realize a utopia where people connected with each other at the level of consciousness. However, new social problems such as personal data leaks and proliferation of manipulated information began to surface. Nevertheless, people still relied on the Network to exchange information, and proved unable to opt to abandon it.\n\nIn due course, a new Network realm with more effective security measures was developed. This was called Meta Real Network, usually abbreviated as \"the Metal.\"\n\nThe Metal accommodated personal memory data within protected virtual stand-alone organic cyber enclaves called bubble shells and eventually pervaded the everyday lives of people.\n\nHowever, people gradually learned to release and explode their instincts within the secure environment of the Metal. The unleashed instincts pushed each individual's consciousness to drown in the sea of information and to be exposed to the pressures of desire.

He is considered a failure as a soldier and a disgrace to the kingdom, making him the perfect man to throw at the succubus' mercy. Assuming it is a one-way journey, Ryuuto prepares to meet his inevitable end. However, after he arrives in the village, he is greeted by Shamsiel herself.\n\nHaving heard the news of a knight sent to defeat her, Shamsiel decides to test Ryuuto's endurance first hand. To her utmost surprise and disbelief, she is incapable of draining Ryuuto's energy. His stamina keeps replenishing, and soon, he will be the one with the upper hand.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 767, "type": "anime", "name": "Majin", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/767/Majin"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 12, "type": "anime", "name": "Hentai", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/12/Hentai"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 35, "type": "anime", "name": "Harem", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/35/Harem"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 40176, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/40176/Miru_Tights__Cosplay_Satsuei_Tights", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1003/102303.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1003/102303t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1003/102303l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1003/102303.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1003/102303t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1003/102303l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Miru Tights: Cosplay Satsuei Tights"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Miru Tights Special"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u307f\u308b\u30bf\u30a4\u30c4 \u30b3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u64ae\u5f71 \u30bf\u30a4\u30c4"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Miru Tights: Cosplay Photoshoot Tights"}], "title": "Miru Tights: Cosplay Satsuei Tights", "title_english": "Miru Tights: Cosplay Photoshoot Tights", "title_japanese": "\u307f\u308b\u30bf\u30a4\u30c4 \u30b3\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u64ae\u5f71 \u30bf\u30a4\u30c4", "title_synonyms": ["Miru Tights Special"], "type": "Special", "source": "Original", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2019-08-23T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 23, "month": 8, "year": 2019}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Aug 23, 2019"}, "duration": "4 min", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 6.4, "scored_by": 15389, "rank": 7861, "popularity": 4435, "members": 30290, "favorites": 39, "synopsis": "In the lead-up to a photoshoot in which Yua Nakabeni and Ren Aikawa have been invited to model for an illustrator, the two girls are feeling anxious.

When he finally finds one, he discovers that she and her companions have been raising a girl to be their food so they can eat her and take on her youthful looks. That is how mermaids stay young.

Asahi would have had a bright future ahead of her\u2014had she not died a year prior. Even as a ghost, Asahi wants nothing more than to perform for fans again. When she finds out that Yuuya does not hold the same passion for the idol life that she once did, she is overcome by a fit of rage and demands that he let her take his place. In a strange twist, Yuuya wakes up to find that Asahi has possessed him and can do what he is too lazy to do himself.\n\nWith Asahi performing for him, Yuuya thinks he has a ticket to an easy idol life. However, Asahi has other plans. Though she is no longer alive, she wishes for Yuuya to find the ambition that she still has. Together, she wants them to become the best idol the world has ever seen.
