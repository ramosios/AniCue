One significant difference is its highly positive portrayal of its main character, Cao Cao, who is traditionally the antagonist in not only Japanese manga, but also most novel versions of the Three Kingdoms period, including the original 14th century version, Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong. Another significant difference from others is that the storyline primarily uses the original historical account of the era, Records of Three Kingdoms by Chen Shou, as a reference rather than the aforementioned Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel. By this, the traditional hero of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Liu Bei, takes on relatively less importance within the story and is portrayed in a less positive light. Yet, several aspects of the story are in fact based on the novel version, including the employment of its original characters such as Diao Chan, as well as anachronistic weapons such as Guan Yu's Green Dragon Crescent Blade and Zhang Fei's Viper Blade.\n\nA consistent theme throughout the story is Cao Cao's perpetual desire to break China and its people away from its old systems and ways of thinking and initiate a focus on pragmatism over empty ideals. This often puts him at odds with the prevalent customs and notions of Confucianism and those that support them.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 2009, "broadcast": {"day": "Wednesdays", "time": "00:59", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Wednesdays at 00:59 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 29, "type": "anime", "name": "VAP", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/29/VAP"}, {"mal_id": 3172, "type": "anime", "name": "Arts Pro", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/3172/Arts_Pro"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 11, "type": "anime", "name": "Madhouse", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/11/Madhouse"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 13, "type": "anime", "name": "Historical", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 2873, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/2873/Bible_Black_Only_Version", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/10104.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/10104t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/10104l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/10104.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/10104t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/10104l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Bible Black Only Version"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30d0\u30a4\u30d6\u30eb\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30aa\u30f3\u30ea\u30fc\u7248"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Bible Black Only"}], "title": "Bible Black Only Version", "title_english": "Bible Black Only", "title_japanese": "\u30d0\u30a4\u30d6\u30eb\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30aa\u30f3\u30ea\u30fc\u7248", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "OVA", "source": "Visual novel", "episodes": 2, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2005-07-25T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2006-04-25T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 25, "month": 7, "year": 2005}, "to": {"day": 25, "month": 4, "year": 2006}}, "string": "Jul 25, 2005 to Apr 25, 2006"}, "duration": "27 min per ep", "rating": "Rx - Hentai", "score": 6.76, "scored_by": 9712, "rank": null, "popularity": 5299, "members": 19976, "favorites": 72, "synopsis": "Bible Black Only explores the sexual misadventures of the supporting cast from the main Bible Black series.

No monsters and tactics had any effect on the waves of dimensional monsters pouring out of the dimensional gates. City after city was mercilessly destroyed.\n\nBut the opening of the dimensional gates did not only cause damage and destruction. The psychokinetic power that it awoke also enabled a tiny minority of humans to gain extraordinary psychic powers. With these psychic warriors, governments around the world were able to turn the tide of the war with these monsters. After unspeakable losses, the people of earth at least succeeded in closing the gates. Since they had closed the gates, these psychics began to be called \"CLOSERS,\" and the invasion of the dimensional monsters was named the First Dimensional War.\n\nWith the dimensional monsters vanquished, peace returned to the world, and the cities were rebuilt. Through dedicated research into the dimensional gates and psychokinetic power, humans learned that the gates open when there is a singularity in this mysterious power. However, their understanding of the gates was still incomplete. The CLOSERS who survived the First Dimensional War became part of an organization called UNION.

Humorously, as the girls discuss which is the smartest, most elegant, strongest, and the leader of the Senshi, Usagi claims those titles for herself. Chibiusa shakes her head at Usagi's delusion. Clips are shown from the debut of each Sailor Senshi, and that girl's image song is played in the background. When even Tuxedo Mask is mentioned, and the girls go to leave without having mentioned Sailor Moon, Usagi butts in on their conversation and asks them directly about Sailor Moon. The girls give a series of glowing compliments about Sailor Moon, but unlike they did for the other Senshi, they also list her faults. After the girls leave, Usagi sarcastically apologises for being a clumsy cry-baby and then bursts into tears.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)", "background": "This was released on Blu ray by Viz Media in 2017.", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 119, "type": "anime", "name": "VIZ Media", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/119/VIZ_Media"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 18, "type": "anime", "name": "Toei Animation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/18/Toei_Animation"}], "genres": [], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 66, "type": "anime", "name": "Mahou Shoujo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/66/Mahou_Shoujo"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 25, "type": "anime", "name": "Shoujo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo"}]}, {"mal_id": 31280, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/31280/Selector_Destructed_WIXOSS_Movie", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/83118.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/83118t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/83118l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/83118.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/83118t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/83118l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "mWKqrgiyQOo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWKqrgiyQOo", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/mWKqrgiyQOo?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/mWKqrgiyQOo/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/mWKqrgiyQOo/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/mWKqrgiyQOo/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/mWKqrgiyQOo/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/mWKqrgiyQOo/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Selector Destructed WIXOSS Movie"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u5287\u5834\u7248 selector destructed WIXOSS"}], "title": "Selector Destructed WIXOSS Movie", "title_english": null, "title_japanese": "\u5287\u5834\u7248 selector destructed WIXOSS", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "Movie", "source": "Card game", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2016-02-13T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 13, "month": 2, "year": 2016}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Feb 13, 2016"}, "duration": "1 hr 29 min", "rating": "R - 17+ (violence & profanity)", "score": 7.19, "scored_by": 6448, "rank": 3505, "popularity": 5391, "members": 19034, "favorites": 31, "synopsis": "This movie is a retelling/summary of Selector Infected and Spread, with extra scenes interspersed such as the characters in childhood.

Now, as the invaders pace behind the northern borders, coveting the small kingdom's magic and high technology, Liberl slowly rebuilds with the aid of the Bracer's Guild, whose mystical use of \"Craft\" is even more intrinsic to the nation's defense than its own army. For young Estelle Bright, daughter of Cassius, this is all just ancient history that she and her adopted brother Joshua learned as kids. But history has a way of repeating itself, and as they prepare to join the Bracers Guild themselves, sinister forces are preparing to thrust them into the familiar family situation of being in the worst possible place when mayhem breaks out. Because when their father's airship goes suddenly missing, of course it only makes sense to two green, but extraordinarily capable, young teenagers to strike out on a rescue mission of their own! \n\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 468, "type": "anime", "name": "Nihon Falcom", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/468/Nihon_Falcom"}, {"mal_id": 775, "type": "anime", "name": "Bushiroad", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/775/Bushiroad"}, {"mal_id": 777, "type": "anime", "name": "Showgate", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/777/Showgate"}, {"mal_id": 3098, "type": "anime", "name": "Aquatone", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/3098/Aquatone"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 376, "type": "anime", "name": "Sentai Filmworks", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 290, "type": "anime", "name": "Kinema Citrus", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/290/Kinema_Citrus"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 49627, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/49627/Shingeki_no_Kyojin__The_Final_Season_Specials", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1470/117265.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1470/117265t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1470/117265l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1470/117265.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1470/117265t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1470/117265l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season Specials"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Shingeki no Kyojin Season 4 Specials"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Attack on Titan Season 4 Specials"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Attack on Titan: The Final Season Specials"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u9032\u6483\u306e\u5de8\u4eba The Final Season Specials"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Attack on Titan: Chibi Theater - Survey Corps, The Final!"}], "title": "Shingeki no Kyojin: The Final Season Specials", "title_english": "Attack on Titan: Chibi Theater - Survey Corps, The Final!", "title_japanese": "\u9032\u6483\u306e\u5de8\u4eba The Final Season Specials", "title_synonyms": ["Shingeki no Kyojin Season 4 Specials", "Attack on Titan Season 4 Specials", "Attack on Titan: The Final Season Specials"], "type": "Special", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 2, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2021-07-07T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2021-08-04T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 7, "month": 7, "year": 2021}, "to": {"day": 4, "month": 8, "year": 2021}}, "string": "Jul 7, 2021 to Aug 4, 2021"}, "duration": "5 min per ep", "rating": "G - All Ages", "score": 7.66, "scored_by": 6486, "rank": 1453, "popularity": 5457, "members": 18406, "favorites": 106, "synopsis": "Shingeki no Kyojin Season 4 DVD/BD specials.

While together with his partner, Youichi Kuramochi, they are the cornerstones of the team's defense on the field.  Youichi is shadowed by his younger brother, Haruichi, whose admiration for Ryousuke is only matched by his own skills at the sport. Together with Yoichi's roommate, Eijun Sawamura, the players reminisce about their path to Seidou High.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 159, "type": "anime", "name": "Kodansha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Production I.G", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"}, {"mal_id": 11, "type": "anime", "name": "Madhouse", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/11/Madhouse"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 30, "type": "anime", "name": "Sports", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/30/Sports"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}, {"mal_id": 77, "type": "anime", "name": "Team Sports", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/77/Team_Sports"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]}, {"mal_id": 32228, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/32228/Teekyuu_7", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/77830.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/77830t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/77830l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/77830.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/77830t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/77830l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "p00QymTDr58", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p00QymTDr58", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/p00QymTDr58?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/p00QymTDr58/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/p00QymTDr58/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/p00QymTDr58/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/p00QymTDr58/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/p00QymTDr58/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Teekyuu 7"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u3066\u30fc\u304d\u3085\u3046 7\u671f"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Teekyu 7"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "Teekyu 7"}], "title": "Teekyuu 7", "title_english": "Teekyu 7", "title_japanese": "\u3066\u30fc\u304d\u3085\u3046 7\u671f", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "TV", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2016-01-12T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2016-03-29T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 12, "month": 1, "year": 2016}, "to": {"day": 29, "month": 3, "year": 2016}}, "string": "Jan 12, 2016 to Mar 29, 2016"}, "duration": "2 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 -

The orphaned Maia Mizuki, 15, just graduated from middle school and has already applied for employment in the elite paramilitary Ocean Agency, part of the futuristic world government. Only the best, most intelligent, and physically fit students are eligible for admission. Maia, the series' protagonist, is set to become one of the few.\n\nBut her ideal life quickly falls apart. To her disappointment, Maia unexpectedly fails her entrance exams. Making matters worse, she promptly gets evicted from her house, pick pocketed, taken hostage, then shot. She is \"saved\" by two women (Rena and Shizuka) that are part of an unorthodox help-for-hire organization called Nereids (inspired by the Greek mythological Nereids ). With nowhere to go, Maia joins up with Nereids, taking jobs from capturing wanted criminals to chasing stray cats, often with unexpected results. Gloria and Yu later join up with Nereids.\n\n\"Daphne\" in the title refers to a subplot that starts midway into the series and eventually become important to Maia. \"Brilliant Blue\" refers to the fact that this is a world covered by water with almost no land.
