What could possibly go wrong there?\n\nThey may not be on the A-list, the B-List, or even the C-list to start, but with a little love and a whole lot of hard work, it's possible that all Japan may someday wake up to the music of WAKE UP, GIRLS!\n\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 16, "type": "anime", "name": "TV Tokyo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"}, {"mal_id": 52, "type": "anime", "name": "Avex Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/52/Avex_Entertainment"}, {"mal_id": 64, "type": "anime", "name": "Sotsu", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/64/Sotsu"}, {"mal_id": 167, "type": "anime", "name": "Sega", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/167/Sega"}, {"mal_id": 198, "type": "anime", "name": "Gakken", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/198/Gakken"}, {"mal_id": 211, "type": "anime", "name": "Rakuonsha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/211/Rakuonsha"}, {"mal_id": 238, "type": "anime", "name": "AT-X", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"}, {"mal_id": 245, "type": "anime", "name": "TOHO", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/245/TOHO"}, {"mal_id": 1039, "type": "anime", "name": "DIVE II Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1039/DIVE_II_Entertainment"}, {"mal_id": 1261, "type": "anime", "name": "Good Smile Company", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1261/Good_Smile_Company"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 376, "type": "anime", "name": "Sentai Filmworks", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 103, "type": "anime", "name": "Tatsunoko Production", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/103/Tatsunoko_Production"}, {"mal_id": 334, "type": "anime", "name": "Ordet", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/334/Ordet"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 60, "type": "anime", "name": "Idols (Female)", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/60/Idols_Female"}, {"mal_id": 19, "type": "anime", "name": "Music", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/19/Music"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 1961, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/1961/Arashi_no_Yoru_ni", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/5064.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/5064t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/5064l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/5064.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/5064t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/5064l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "bVmh_C8LnbY", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVmh_C8LnbY", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/bVmh_C8LnbY?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/bVmh_C8LnbY/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/bVmh_C8LnbY/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/bVmh_C8LnbY/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/bVmh_C8LnbY/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/bVmh_C8LnbY/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Arashi no Yoru ni"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "In the Night of the Storm"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "On A Stormy Night"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Stormy Night"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u3042\u3089\u3057\u306e\u3088\u308b\u306b"}, {"type": "English", "title": "One Stormy Night"}, {"type": "French", "title": "La Vallee D'Emeraude Stormy Night"}], "title": "Arashi no Yoru ni", "title_english": "One Stormy Night", "title_japanese": "\u3042\u3089\u3057\u306e\u3088\u308b\u306b", "title_synonyms": ["In the Night of the Storm", "On A Stormy Night", "Stormy Night"], "type": "Movie", "source": "Book", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2005-12-10T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 10, "month": 12, "year": 2005}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Dec 10, 2005"}, "duration": "1 hr 47 min", "rating": "G - All Ages", "score": 7.64, "scored_by": 11374, "rank": 1492, "popularity": 4806, "members": 25193, "favorites": 215, "synopsis": "When a sudden thunderstorm strikes, Mei, a young goat, has no choice but to take shelter in an abandoned barn.

In all of these horrifying stories, nothing is as simple as it seems, revealing a terrifying darkness that perhaps might have been best left alone.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 2017, "broadcast": {"day": "Mondays", "time": "03:35", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Mondays at 03:35 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 16, "type": "anime", "name": "TV Tokyo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 1169, "type": "anime", "name": "ILCA", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1169/ILCA"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 14, "type": "anime", "name": "Horror", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/14/Horror"}, {"mal_id": 37, "type": "anime", "name": "Supernatural", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 49026, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/49026/Yuru_Camp\u25b3_Season_2_Specials", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1542/115070.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1542/115070t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1542/115070l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1542/115070.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1542/115070t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1542/115070l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Yuru Camp\u25b3 Season 2 Specials"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Laid-back Camp Season 2"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u3086\u308b\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u25b3 SEASON2"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Laid-Back Camp Season 2 Specials"}], "title": "Yuru Camp\u25b3 Season 2 Specials", "title_english": "Laid-Back Camp Season 2 Specials", "title_japanese": "\u3086\u308b\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u25b3 SEASON2", "title_synonyms": ["Laid-back Camp Season 2"], "type": "Special", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 2, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2021-05-26T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2021-07-28T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 26, "month": 5, "year": 2021}, "to": {"day": 28, "month": 7, "year": 2021}}, "string": "May 26, 2021 to Jul 28, 2021"}, "duration": "4 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.48, "scored_by": 8001, "rank": 2115, "popularity": 4848, "members": 24638, "favorites": 70, "synopsis": "Mystery Camp\nRelaxing in the heart of nature is a constant joy for Nadeshiko Kagamihara, Aoi Inuyama, and their friends.

From this, the man, Hyakkimaru, reveals that many of his body parts were stolen by demons and that though he sought a peaceful life, he couldn't escape their relentless onslaught. Despite the tale, Dororo still insists on tagging along.

GaoGaiGar's pilot, Guy Shishio, is a former astronaut who was nearly killed two years before when the Zonders first crashed to earth. Guy's life was spared when a mysterious robot lion called Galeon pulled him from the burning shuttle and brought him to Earth.

While both are unable to properly communicate their intentions at first, they gradually form a companionship where they protect each other.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 2024, "broadcast": {"day": "Sundays", "time": "02:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Sundays at 02:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 1500, "type": "anime", "name": "ABC Animation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1500/ABC_Animation"}, {"mal_id": 2924, "type": "anime", "name": "East Press", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2924/East_Press"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 839, "type": "anime", "name": "LIDENFILMS", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/839/LIDENFILMS"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 6, "type": "anime", "name": "Mythology", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/6/Mythology"}, {"mal_id": 82, "type": "anime", "name": "Urban Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/82/Urban_Fantasy"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 31853, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/31853/Biohazard__Vendetta", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/83300.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/83300t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/83300l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/83300.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/83300t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/83300l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "LwKRTO93Y2w", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwKRTO93Y2w", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/LwKRTO93Y2w?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/LwKRTO93Y2w/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/LwKRTO93Y2w/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/LwKRTO93Y2w/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/LwKRTO93Y2w/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/LwKRTO93Y2w/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Biohazard: Vendetta"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30d0\u30a4\u30aa\u30cf\u30b6\u30fc\u30c9 \u30f4\u30a7\u30f3\u30c7\u30c3\u30bf"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Resident Evil: Vendetta"}, {"type": "German", "title": "Resident Evil: Vendetta"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "Resident Evil: Vendetta"}, {"type": "French", "title": "Resident Evil: Vendetta"}], "title": "Biohazard: Vendetta", "title_english": "Resident Evil: Vendetta", "title_japanese": "\u30d0\u30a4\u30aa\u30cf\u30b6\u30fc\u30c9 \u30f4\u30a7\u30f3\u30c7\u30c3\u30bf", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "Movie", "source": "Game", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2017-05-27T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 27, "month": 5, "year": 2017}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "May 27, 2017"}, "duration": "1 hr 37 min", "rating": "R - 17+ (violence & profanity)", "score": 6.96, "scored_by": 13762, "rank": 4677, "popularity": 4895, "members": 24205, "favorites": 67, "synopsis": "Chris Redfield enlists the help of Leon S.

Still, Yuu manages to befriend Atori and pledges to spend as much time as possible together, not knowing there are others vying for Atori's attention.

But it is easier said than done, especially when Hana's ignorance\u2014combined with her innocence\u2014makes her a woman that Yuuichi can't help but desire.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 519, "type": "anime", "name": "Collaboration Works", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/519/Collaboration_Works"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 12, "type": "anime", "name": "Hentai", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/12/Hentai"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 21325, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/21325/Pupipo", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/58853.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/58853t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/58853l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/58853.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/58853t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/58853l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "_9pPuUWVX1A", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9pPuUWVX1A", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/_9pPuUWVX1A?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/_9pPuUWVX1A/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/_9pPuUWVX1A/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/_9pPuUWVX1A/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/_9pPuUWVX1A/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/_9pPuUWVX1A/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Pupipo!"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Pupipoo!"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30d7\u30d4\u30dd\u30fc\uff01"}], "title": "Pupipo!", "title_english": null, "title_japanese": "\u30d7\u30d4\u30dd\u30fc\uff01", "title_synonyms": ["Pupipoo!"], "type": "TV", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 15, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2013-12-21T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2014-03-29T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 21, "month": 12, "year": 2013}, "to": {"day": 29, "month": 3, "year": 2014}}, "string": "Dec 21, 2013 to Mar 29, 2014"}, "duration": "4 min per ep", "rating": "PG - Children", "score": 6.78, "scored_by": 10626, "rank": 5583, "popularity": 4994, "members": 23133, "favorites": 45, "synopsis": "Himeji Wakaba is a 5th year elementary school student, and she has the ability to see things that others can't.

On a couple of occasions, she brings home stray animals, but her parents won't let her keep them. However, they're worried about their sad, creepy daughter, so one day they decide that whatever Wakaba brings home next, they'll let her keep.\n\nThe next thing she brings home is a pink monster called \"Pupipo\", but her parents stand by their decision and let her keep it. No one is quite sure what Pupipo is, but it protects Wakaba from the other things she sees. Pupipo also helps Wakaba make friends with an occult-obsessed transfer student and solve problems with bullying.

Having sworn revenge on Asagi, she abducts her\u2014along with Sawaki and her younger sister Sakura\u2014and subjects them to sexual and psychological abuse without mercy. \n\nThough Asagi's resolution is absolute, there is little she can do when Oboro turns the ninja's closest ones against her by humiliating them in the most heinous ways imaginable.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Taimanin Asagi was released on DVD in four volumes by Pixy from March 2, 2007 to August 29, 2008.", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 195, "type": "anime", "name": "Pixy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/195/Pixy"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 1463, "type": "anime", "name": "Anime Antenna Iinkai", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1463/Anime_Antenna_Iinkai"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 37, "type": "anime", "name": "Supernatural", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}, {"mal_id": 12, "type": "anime", "name": "Hentai", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/12/Hentai"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 1219, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/1219/Chocotto_Sister", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/16825.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/16825t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/16825l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/16825.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/16825t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/16825l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Chocotto Sister"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Chokotto Sister"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u3061\u3087\u3053\u30c3\u3068Sister"}], "title": "Chocotto Sister", "title_english": null, "title_japanese": "\u3061\u3087\u3053\u30c3\u3068Sister", "title_synonyms": ["Chokotto Sister"], "type": "TV", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 24, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2006-07-12T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2006-12-20T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 12, "month": 7, "year": 2006}, "to": {"day": 20, "month": 12, "year": 2006}}, "string": "Jul 12, 2006 to Dec 20, 2006"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "R+ - Mild Nudity", "score": 6.74, "scored_by": 8988, "rank": 5781, "popularity": 5030, "members": 22599, "favorites": 40, "synopsis": "Haruma Kawagoe is an only child.

But with the set series of tragedies meant to befall the protagonist at the hands of Shen Qingqiu, this teacher has his work cut out for him.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Adaptation based on a Chinese web novel of the same name, written by Mo Xiang Tong Xiu (\u58a8\u9999\u94dc\u81ed).", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 1727, "type": "anime", "name": "Tencent Video", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1727/Tencent_Video"}, {"mal_id": 1806, "type": "anime", "name": "iQIYI", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1806/iQIYI"}, {"mal_id": 2106, "type": "anime", "name": "Sony Music Solutions", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2106/Sony_Music_Solutions"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 2133, "type": "anime", "name": "Djinn Power", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2133/Djinn_Power"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 13, "type": "anime", "name": "Historical", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}, {"mal_id": 62, "type": "anime", "name": "Isekai", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/62/Isekai"}, {"mal_id": 6, "type": "anime", "name": "Mythology", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/6/Mythology"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 36000, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/36000/Sora_to_Umi_no_Aida", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1297/97156.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1297/97156t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1297/97156l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1297/97156.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1297/97156t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1297/97156l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "DcAfBkSXFxs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcAfBkSXFxs", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/DcAfBkSXFxs?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/DcAfBkSXFxs/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/DcAfBkSXFxs/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/DcAfBkSXFxs/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/DcAfBkSXFxs/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/DcAfBkSXFxs/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Sora to Umi no Aida"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30bd\u30e9\u3068\u30a6\u30df\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c0"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Between the Sky and Sea"}, {"type": "French", "title": "Between the Sky and Sea"}], "title": "Sora to Umi no Aida", "title_english": "Between the Sky and Sea", "title_japanese": "\u30bd\u30e9\u3068\u30a6\u30df\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c0", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "TV", "source": "Game", "episodes": 12, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2018-10-04T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2018-12-20T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 4, "month": 10, "year": 2018}, "to": {"day": 20, "month": 12, "year": 2018}}, "string": "Oct 4, 2018 to Dec 20, 2018"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 5.68, "scored_by": 6931, "rank": 11795, "popularity": 5070, "members": 22221, "favorites": 21, "synopsis": "In the future in Onomichi, Hiroshima fish disappear from the sea around the world and only whales live in the ocean.

Joined by the not-so-black, demon cat Kira, and their terrifying rent-hungry landlady, this is the story of the man who was most definitely not London's greatest detective.", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 2015, "broadcast": {"day": "Saturdays", "time": "01:55", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Saturdays at 01:55 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 1795, "type": "anime", "name": "CUCURI", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1795/CUCURI"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 1266, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio!

Following an unofficial double promotion and a flurry of media attention, he chronicles his research of the Year 730 Mafia\u2014a close-knit group of Alliance military officers centered around the famed tactician Bruce Ashbey. He investigates a startling claim by Ashbey's deceased widow that may have enormous political ramifications: that the great war hero was not killed in action but murdered.\n\nThe Mutineer\nReinhard and Kircheis are posted on the destroyer Hameln II, docked at Iserlohn Fortress. After gaining the respect of the crew, Reinhard's leadership is tested when the captain is severely wounded and passes command authority to Reinhard, the next-highest ranking officer on deck.\n\nThe Duelist\nWhile Reinhard and Kircheis are working in the Imperial capital Odin, Reinhard learns of a mining rights dispute involving Dorothea von Schaffhausen, a friend of his sister Annerose von Gr\u00fcnewald. Upon hearing that Count Herxheimer intends to settle the matter with a duel, Reinhard volunteers to represent the Schaffhausen family.\n\nThe Retriever\nAfter falling out of favor with the nobility, Count Herxheimer is trying to escape to the Free Planets Alliance with a stolen Seffle particle generator prototype. Reinhard is tasked with retrieving both the prototype and the defector, but is only assigned the cruiser H\u00e4ssliche Entlein due to the confidential nature of the mission.\n\nThe Third Battle of Tiamat\nTo commemorate the 30th year of the reign of Kaiser Friedrich IV, the Empire announces a large-scale military campaign against the Free Planets Alliance. In the ensuing clash between the Imperial expeditionary force and three Alliance fleets, Reinhard's timely intervention shapes the tides of war.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 382, "type": "anime", "name": "Tokuma Shoten", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/382/Tokuma_Shoten"}, {"mal_id": 905, "type": "anime", "name": "Tokuma Japan", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/905/Tokuma_Japan"}, {"mal_id": 2434, "type": "anime", "name": "Wright Staff", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2434/Wright_Staff"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 376, "type": "anime", "name": "Sentai Filmworks", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 1269, "type": "anime", "name": "K-Factory", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1269/K-Factory"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 50, "type": "anime", "name": "Adult Cast", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"}, {"mal_id": 38, "type": "anime", "name": "Military", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"}, {"mal_id": 29, "type": "anime", "name": "Space", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/29/Space"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 42867, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/42867/Kanojo_Okarishimasu_Petit", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1582/109275.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1582/109275t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1582/109275l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1582/109275.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1582/109275t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1582/109275l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Kanojo, Okarishimasu Petit"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Kanojo"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Okarishimasu Puchi"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Rent-a-Girlfriend Chibi"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Kanojo"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Okarishimasu Mini Anime"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u5f7c\u5973, \u304a\u501f\u308a\u3057\u307e\u3059 \u3077\u3061"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Rent-a-Girlfriend Petit"}], "title": "Kanojo, Okarishimasu Petit", "title_english": "Rent-a-Girlfriend Petit", "title_japanese": "\u5f7c\u5973, \u304a\u501f\u308a\u3057\u307e\u3059 \u3077\u3061", "title_synonyms": ["Kanojo", "Okarishimasu Puchi", "Rent-a-Girlfriend Chibi", "Kanojo", "Okarishimasu Mini Anime"], "type": "ONA", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 14, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2020-07-17T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2020-10-01T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 17, "month": 7, "year": 2020}, "to": {"day": 1, "month": 10, "year": 2020}}, "string": "Jul 17, 2020 to Oct 1, 2020"}, "duration": "1 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 5.92, "scored_by": 6686, "rank": 10574, "popularity": 5081, "members": 22077, "favorites": 47, "synopsis": "Short episodes with super-deformed characters posted on the official Twitter account.

Seeing his hapless predicament, a nervous Kudryavka \"Kud\" Noumi musters enough courage to confront her feelings while asking Riki to sleep in her room instead. Despite the rest of the Little Busters incessantly teasing Kud and Riki about their relationship, he stays with her throughout the summer. As they share unforgettable experiences one after another, the two realize that they might want to be more than just friends.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Kud Wafter is an adaptation of Key's visual novel of the same name.
