Feeling that he did not want the boy to idolize a villain, Tiger was inspired to be a heroic wrestler.\n\nThe main antagonist in the manga and anime was Tigers' Den, a mysterious organization that trained young people to be villainous heel wrestlers on the condition that they gave half of their earnings to the organization.

This infuriated the leader of the organization and he sent numerous assassins, including other professional wrestlers, to punish him.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)", "background": "", "season": "fall", "year": 1969, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": "Unknown"}, "producers": [], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 18, "type": "anime", "name": "Toei Animation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/18/Toei_Animation"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 30, "type": "anime", "name": "Sports", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/30/Sports"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 54, "type": "anime", "name": "Combat Sports", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/54/Combat_Sports"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]}, {"mal_id": 50599, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/50599/Yami_Shibai_10", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1760/120105.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1760/120105t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1760/120105l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1760/120105.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1760/120105t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1760/120105l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Yami Shibai 10"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Yamishibai: Japanese Ghost Stories Tenth Season"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Yamishibai: Japanese Ghost Stories 10"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u95c7\u829d\u5c45 \u5341\u671f"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Theatre of Darkness: Yamishibai 10"}], "title": "Yami Shibai 10", "title_english": "Theatre of Darkness: Yamishibai 10", "title_japanese": "\u95c7\u829d\u5c45 \u5341\u671f", "title_synonyms": ["Yamishibai: Japanese Ghost Stories Tenth Season", "Yamishibai: Japanese Ghost Stories 10"], "type": "TV", "source": "Original", "episodes": 13, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2022-01-10T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2022-04-04T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 10, "month": 1, "year": 2022}, "to": {"day": 4, "month": 4, "year": 2022}}, "string": "Jan 10, 2022 to Apr 4, 2022"}, "duration": "4 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 -

But an international criminal group, Gallactor, tries to achieve world domination by taking control of the ISO. Gallactor was created by a mysterious being from outer space known as Generalissimo X, who gives orders through its chief commander on Earth, the masked Berg Katse. To fight Gallactor and its robot monsters, the ISO's Dr. Nambu enlists five brave youths into a combat squad called Gatchaman,the Science Commandos. Special scientific powers and dramatic birdlike costumes make the Gatchaman Squad a match for Gallactor, wherever on Earth it may strike. Ken (the Eagle) is the wise leader, assisted by sometimes-foolhardy Joe (the Condor), pretty Jun (the Swan), eager little Jinpei (the Swallow), and strong Ryu (the Horned Owl). Each has individual scientific weapons, but their main power lies in their aircraft, the Phoenix, which can transform itself into a fiery arrow capable of piercing the most massive threats.

As stated in the postscript, the author believed this reading would further entice people to watch the film. The movie was broadcasted several times on Yomiuri TV's Anime Daisuki! program. An English version was made available under the title Once Upon a Time by Harmony Gold in 1987. However, in order to make it suitable for a younger audience, major changes were made: the exclusion of some nudity and violent scenes, modification of the script, new character names, and added narration. In Japan, Windaria was initially distributed to home video by Victor Entertainment, which later released it on DVD on December 16, 2000. In the US, it was made available on VHS as Windaria by Streamline Pictures on August 1, 1993, and on DVD as Once Upon a Time by ADV Films on March 16, 2004. Additionally, a video game adaptation titled Dungeon of Windaria was released in Japan by Nintendo on May 15, 2008.", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 36, "type": "anime", "name": "Gallop", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/36/Gallop"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 97, "type": "anime", "name": "ADV Films", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/97/ADV_Films"}, {"mal_id": 2278, "type": "anime", "name": "Harmony Gold", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2278/Harmony_Gold"}, {"mal_id": 2518, "type": "anime", "name": "Streamline Pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2518/Streamline_Pictures"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 288, "type": "anime", "name": "Kaname Productions", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/288/Kaname_Productions"}, {"mal_id": 1943, "type": "anime", "name": "Idol", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1943/Idol"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 19575, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/19575/Kobayashi_ga_Kawai_sugite_Tsurai", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/52439.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/52439t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/52439l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/52439.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/52439t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/10/52439l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Kobayashi ga Kawai sugite Tsurai!!"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u5c0f\u6797\u304c\u53ef\u611b\u3059\u304e\u3066\u30c4\u30e9\u30a4\u3063!!"}, {"type": "English", "title": "So Cute It Hurts!!"}], "title": "Kobayashi ga Kawai sugite Tsurai!!", "title_english": "So Cute It Hurts!!", "title_japanese": "\u5c0f\u6797\u304c\u53ef\u611b\u3059\u304e\u3066\u30c4\u30e9\u30a4\u3063!!", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "OVA", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 2, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2013-07-26T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2014-03-26T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 26, "month": 7, "year": 2013}, "to": {"day": 26, "month": 3, "year": 2014}}, "string": "Jul 26, 2013 to Mar 26, 2014"}, "duration": "16 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 6.15, "scored_by": 4502, "rank": 9325, "popularity": 6711, "members": 10831, "favorites": 10, "synopsis": "Twins Megumu Kobayashi and Mitsuru Kobayashi attend different schools, one for girls and one for boys.
