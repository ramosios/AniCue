He gives no thought to his recurring dream of a girl whose face can never clearly see.\n\nThat evening, one of Jiang Xiaobai's seniors passes him the task of rushing to the airport to escort the idiosyncratic rising author Tong Li, who has returned from America to launch her first serialized novel in Chinese.

Miyu's knowledge of dogs is nonexistent, and the puppy's rowdiness leaves him in danger of being evicted from his own home. \n\nWhen Miyu decides to take the puppy on a walk, he has a chance encounter with professional dog trainer Shinichirou Niwa and Niwa's well-behaved standard poodle Ourson. In just a matter of minutes, Niwa not only corrects the attitude of Miyu's dog, but also gives Miyu himself stern advice on how to treat his pet properly. Amazed by Niwa's techniques, Miyu decides to quit his job in order to become the trainer's assistant; however, Niwa is not as skillful in dealing with humans as he is with their canine companions. Even so, Miyu refuses to give up on Niwa and his failing business.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "fall", "year": 2023, "broadcast": {"day": "Sundays", "time": "17:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Sundays at 17:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 111, "type": "anime", "name": "NHK", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/111/NHK"}, {"mal_id": 1797, "type": "anime", "name": "NHK Enterprises", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1797/NHK_Enterprises"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 2821, "type": "anime", "name": "Fugaku", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2821/Fugaku"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 36, "type": "anime", "name": "Slice of Life", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 50, "type": "anime", "name": "Adult Cast", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"}, {"mal_id": 71, "type": "anime", "name": "Pets", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/71/Pets"}, {"mal_id": 48, "type": "anime", "name": "Workplace", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/48/Workplace"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 43, "type": "anime", "name": "Josei", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/43/Josei"}]}, {"mal_id": 56189, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/56189/Grendizer_U", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1380/143464.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1380/143464t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1380/143464l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1380/143464.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1380/143464t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1380/143464l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "K0x-WZb2zYo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0x-WZb2zYo", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/K0x-WZb2zYo?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/K0x-WZb2zYo/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/K0x-WZb2zYo/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/K0x-WZb2zYo/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/K0x-WZb2zYo/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/K0x-WZb2zYo/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Grendizer U"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30b0\u30ec\u30f3\u30c0\u30a4\u30b6\u30fcU"}], "title": "Grendizer U", "title_english": null, "title_japanese": "\u30b0\u30ec\u30f3\u30c0\u30a4\u30b6\u30fcU", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "TV", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 13, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2024-07-06T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2024-09-28T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 6, "month": 7, "year": 2024}, "to": {"day": 28, "month": 9, "year": 2024}}, "string": "Jul 6, 2024 to Sep 28, 2024"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 5.82, "scored_by": 2020, "rank": 11146, "popularity": 7537, "members": 8189, "favorites": 36, "synopsis": "Duke Fleed is a survivor of the Fleed Planet who has escaped to Earth.
