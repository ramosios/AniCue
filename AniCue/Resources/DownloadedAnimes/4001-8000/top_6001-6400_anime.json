Moans of ecstasy and frenzy reverberate across the world from those desperate to seek relief from their relief.\n \nAlthough the streets run white with bodily fluids, people are far from relieved of their sexual troubles; fortunately, it is the perfect time to search for solutions! Inspiration can be found around every corner as encounters with the pollinic beings expose both hidden feelings and alluring physicality. Regardless of the climax that each person reaches, one thing is for sure\u2014no amount of tissues will be enough for this allergy season.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 45, "type": "anime", "name": "Pink Pineapple", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/45/Pink_Pineapple"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 405, "type": "anime", "name": "T-Rex", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/405/T-Rex"}, {"mal_id": 2333, "type": "anime", "name": "Space-X", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2333/Space-X"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 12, "type": "anime", "name": "Hentai", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/12/Hentai"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 1041, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/1041/Zetsuai_1989", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1998/116562.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1998/116562t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1998/116562l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1998/116562.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1998/116562t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1998/116562l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Zetsuai 1989"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Desperate Love"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Everlasting Love"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Bronze: 1989"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u7d76\u611b-1989-"}], "title": "Zetsuai 1989", "title_english": null, "title_japanese": "\u7d76\u611b-1989-", "title_synonyms": ["Desperate Love", "Everlasting Love", "Bronze: 1989"], "type": "OVA", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "1992-07-29T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 29, "month": 7, "year": 1992}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Jul 29, 1992"}, "duration": "45 min", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 6.29, "scored_by": 6994, "rank": null, "popularity": 6019, "members": 14167, "favorites": 37, "synopsis": "On his way back from his late-night job at a gas station, Takuto Izumi spots a young man passed out drunk on the side of the road.

The second sister is Kaname Onee-sama. She is a popular lawyer and is known as the \"Icy Lawyer\". In fact, she is my first love. The third is Serori Ne-Ne. She is half Japanese and half North European. She has the most voluptuous body of all the sisters, but her behavior is very childish. The fourth is Tomoe Ne. Although she looks quite stern, she is actually quite gentle and gets teased by the other sisters. The fifth is Takane Aneki. She is highhanded, and treats me like a servant. She often beats me. The youngest sister is Umi Oneechan. She takes care of me a lot, and devotes much love to me.\n\nWhen I was a child, I was adopted by the Hiiragi family. But because the father was afraid that the sisters would spoil me, I was sent to a relative to train myself. It is the first time I`ve gone home since then. I was very excited to see them again, especially Kaname, my first love.\n\nThey welcomed me home, but late at night, Kaname Onee-sama raped me, and treated me like a toy. I felt very ashamed and I made up my mind to train my sex technique to put her to shame...with the help of the other sisters.\n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 244, "type": "anime", "name": "D3", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/244/D3"}, {"mal_id": 1327, "type": "anime", "name": "White Bear", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1327/White_Bear"}, {"mal_id": 1424, "type": "anime", "name": "Mediabank", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1424/Mediabank"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 407, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio 9 Maiami", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/407/Studio_9_Maiami"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 12, "type": "anime", "name": "Hentai", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/12/Hentai"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 19029, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/19029/Yuyushiki__Nyanyashiki", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/51019.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/51019t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/51019l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/51019.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/51019t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/51019l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Yuyushiki: Nyanyashiki"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u3086\u3086\u5f0f\u3000\u306b\u3083\u306b\u3083\u5f0f"}], "title": "Yuyushiki: Nyanyashiki", "title_english": null, "title_japanese": "\u3086\u3086\u5f0f\u3000\u306b\u3083\u306b\u3083\u5f0f", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "Special", "source": "4-koma manga", "episodes": 6, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2013-05-29T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2013-10-23T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 29, "month": 5, "year": 2013}, "to": {"day": 23, "month": 10, "year": 2013}}, "string": "May 29, 2013 to Oct 23, 2013"}, "duration": "2 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 6.29, "scored_by": 6064, "rank": 8540, "popularity": 6101, "members": 13695, "favorites": 5, "synopsis": "Specials bundled with the BD/DVD volumes.", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 290, "type": "anime", "name": "Kinema Citrus", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/290/Kinema_Citrus"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 52, "type": "anime", "name": "CGDCT", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/52/CGDCT"}, {"mal_id": 57, "type": "anime", "name": "Gag Humor", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/57/Gag_Humor"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 6330, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/6330/Shakugan_no_Shana__Friagne___Marianne_no_Naze_Nani_Shana_Nandemo_Shitsumonbako", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/14207.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/14207t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/14207l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/14207.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/14207t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/14207l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Shakugan no Shana: Friagne & Marianne no Naze Nani Shana!

Mad Bull makes no qualms about executing common thieves with shotgun blasts if they even pose a minor threat to him or anyone around them. Mad Bull also often steals from prostitutes and does incredible amounts of property damage while fighting crime. Mad Bull's unpoliceman-like behavior often puts him in hot water with his partner Daizaburo and the 34th precinct.

Perrine Valley, a police lieutenant, joins Daizaburo and Sleepy later on to help them tackle more difficult cases involving the mafia and drug-running.\n\nMad Bull 34 is inspired by the high-action buddy cop films of the '70s and '80s.\n\n(Source: Thevinnymac)", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 144, "type": "anime", "name": "Pony Canyon", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/144/Pony_Canyon"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 467, "type": "anime", "name": "Discotek Media", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/467/Discotek_Media"}, {"mal_id": 947, "type": "anime", "name": "Manga Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/947/Manga_Entertainment"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 207, "type": "anime", "name": "Magic Bus", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/207/Magic_Bus"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 39, "type": "anime", "name": "Detective", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/39/Detective"}, {"mal_id": 58, "type": "anime", "name": "Gore", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/58/Gore"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 61304, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/61304/Kuroiwa_Medaka_ni_Watashi_no_Kawaii_ga_Tsuujinai_2nd_Season", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1821/148784.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1821/148784t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1821/148784l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1821/148784.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1821/148784t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1821/148784l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Kuroiwa Medaka ni Watashi no Kawaii ga Tsuujinai 2nd Season"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Medakawa"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "My Charms Are Wasted On Kuroiwa Medaka"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Kuroiwa Medaka is Proof Against My Cuteness."}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u9ed2\u5ca9\u30e1\u30c0\u30ab\u306b\u79c1\u306e\u53ef\u611b\u3044\u304c\u901a\u3058\u306a\u3044 \u7b2c2\u671f"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Medaka Kuroiwa is Impervious to My Charms Season 2"}], "title": "Kuroiwa Medaka ni Watashi no Kawaii ga Tsuujinai 2nd Season", "title_english": "Medaka Kuroiwa is Impervious to My Charms Season 2", "title_japanese": "\u9ed2\u5ca9\u30e1\u30c0\u30ab\u306b\u79c1\u306e\u53ef\u611b\u3044\u304c\u901a\u3058\u306a\u3044 \u7b2c2\u671f", "title_synonyms": ["Medakawa", "My Charms Are Wasted On Kuroiwa Medaka", "Kuroiwa Medaka is Proof Against My Cuteness."], "type": "TV", "source": "Manga", "episodes": null, "status": "Not yet aired", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": null, "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Not available"}, "duration": "Unknown", "rating": "PG-13 -

It ends with profiles of the Baka Rangers (Asuna, Makie, Yue, Ku Fei and Kaede) as well as Ayaka.

Unfortunately for our good guy, he was born into a martial arts family whose head (ie his father) only knows one language: violence. When Koushi was still a baby, his father made a pact with his biggest rival to marry Koushi to his opponent-turned-friend's daughter. The union of the two blood lines is supposed to bring forth Earth's strongest martial arts clan.\n\nSkip forward: Koushi is in high school, oblivious to the marriage arranged for him at his birth. Enter Momoko Kuzuryuu: sugar bomb, airhead, loli martial arts artist and Koushi's self-proclaimed bride (the strongest on Earth, no less). Her wish for sexual intercourse meets with Koushi's square refusal as he has absolutely no desire to get it on with someone who looks like she could be his little sister, not to mention that he doesn't have the foggiest idea who she actually is.\n\nMeanwhile, a war has broken out between the martial arts families. For Koushi, this means that numerous fighters are out to challenge him. As if that weren't bad enough, our protagonist also has a fight phobia due to a traumatic incident that took place in his childhood. Now it's up to Momoko and her superhuman fighting skills to protect her \"husband.\" Will the two sweethearts survive the trials and tribulations ahead of them? More importantly, will Momoko get her way receiving a baby from Koushi?", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 58, "type": "anime", "name": "Square Enix", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/58/Square_Enix"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 101, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio Hibari", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/101/Studio_Hibari"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}, {"mal_id": 9, "type": "anime", "name": "Ecchi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/9/Ecchi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 17, "type": "anime", "name": "Martial Arts", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/17/Martial_Arts"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 12725, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/12725/Initial_D__Project_D_to_the_Next_Stage_-_Project_D_e_Mukete", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/35739.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/35739t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/35739l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/35739.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/35739t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/35739l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Initial D: Project D to the Next Stage - Project D e Mukete"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Initial D: Project D to the Next Stage - Speculations on Project D"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u982d\u6587\u5b57D to the Next Stage \uff5e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8D\u3078\u5411\u3051\u3066\uff5e"}, {"type": "French", "title": "Initial D - OAV"}], "title": "Initial D: Project D to the Next Stage - Project D e Mukete", "title_english": null, "title_japanese": "\u982d\u6587\u5b57D to the Next Stage \uff5e\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8D\u3078\u5411\u3051\u3066\uff5e", "title_synonyms": ["Initial D: Project D to the Next Stage - Speculations on Project D"], "type": "Special", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2003-03-22T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 22, "month": 3, "year": 2003}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Mar 22, 2003"}, "duration": "1 hr 10 min", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.59, "scored_by": 4576, "rank": 1664, "popularity": 6203, "members": 13105, "favorites": 5, "synopsis": "A special that comes with the Fourth Stage DVD-BOX.

When Kalos seemed hopelessly out of balance, the Order Pok\u00e9mon Zygarde appeared to restore it, and Jan remained at Aila\u2019s side as the cycle of life and destruction continued. \n\n(Source: Builbapedia)", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 499, "type": "anime", "name": "The Pokemon Company International", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/499/The_Pokemon_Company_International"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 28, "type": "anime", "name": "OLM", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/28/OLM"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 15, "type": "anime", "name": "Kids", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/15/Kids"}]}, {"mal_id": 4205, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/4205/KimiKiss_Pure_Rouge__Love_Fighter", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1203/127869.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1203/127869t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1203/127869l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1203/127869.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1203/127869t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1203/127869l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "KimiKiss Pure Rouge: Love Fighter"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Kimi-kiss pure rouge"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "KimiKiss Pure Rouge Special"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30ad\u30df\u30ad\u30b9 pure rouge"}], "title": "KimiKiss Pure Rouge: Love Fighter", "title_english": null, "title_japanese": "\u30ad\u30df\u30ad\u30b9 pure rouge", "title_synonyms": ["Kimi-kiss pure rouge", "KimiKiss Pure Rouge Special"], "type": "Special", "source": "Visual novel", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2008-08-22T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 22, "month": 8, "year": 2008}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Aug 22, 2008"}, "duration": "24 min", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 6.91, "scored_by": 7145, "rank": 4879, "popularity": 6215, "members": 13051, "favorites": 5, "synopsis": "DVD only episode entitled 'love fighter'.

It's up to the three of them to find the additional club members they need and become an idol group strong enough to qualify for the Prism Stage and to win it as well.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "summer", "year": 2019, "broadcast": {"day": "Sundays", "time": "22:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Sundays at 22:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 144, "type": "anime", "name": "Pony Canyon", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/144/Pony_Canyon"}, {"mal_id": 1492, "type": "anime", "name": "Yomiuri TV Enterprise", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1492/Yomiuri_TV_Enterprise"}, {"mal_id": 1869, "type": "anime", "name": "Bit Promotion", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1869/Bit_Promotion"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 376, "type": "anime", "name": "Sentai Filmworks", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 96, "type": "anime", "name": "Yumeta Company", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/96/Yumeta_Company"}, {"mal_id": 894, "type": "anime", "name": "Graphinica", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/894/Graphinica"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 36, "type": "anime", "name": "Slice of Life", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 60, "type": "anime", "name": "Idols (Female)", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/60/Idols_Female"}, {"mal_id": 19, "type": "anime", "name": "Music", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/19/Music"}, {"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 58717, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/58717/Garouden__The_Way_of_the_Lone_Wolf", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1534/142687.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1534/142687t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1534/142687l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1534/142687.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1534/142687t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1534/142687l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "7SpSpncmISc", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SpSpncmISc", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/7SpSpncmISc?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/7SpSpncmISc/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/7SpSpncmISc/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/7SpSpncmISc/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/7SpSpncmISc/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/7SpSpncmISc/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Garouden: The Way of the Lone Wolf"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u9913\u72fc\u4f1d: The Way of the Lone Wolf"}], "title": "Garouden: The Way of the Lone Wolf", "title_english": null, "title_japanese": "\u9913\u72fc\u4f1d: The Way of the Lone Wolf", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "ONA", "source": "Novel", "episodes": 8, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2024-05-23T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 23, "month": 5, "year": 2024}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "May 23, 2024"}, "duration": "24 min per ep", "rating": "R - 17+ (violence & profanity)", "score": 6.46, "scored_by": 5203, "rank": 7508, "popularity": 6386, "members": 12231, "favorites": 36, "synopsis": "On the run from his troubled past, Juuzou is forced into competing in a deadly underground fighting tournament.
