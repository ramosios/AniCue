The truth of this is hammered in when Masato sees his parents accept payment for raising him. The Last Guardian is preparing for the resurrection of \"Hau Dragon\", an organization bent on world conquest. 15 years ago, Hau Dragon built 8 great robots. Each of the mecha represents a force of nature. However, before any of the robots could be used, their creater Kihara Masaki destroyed the robots except for the leader: Zeorymer. He took Zeorymer and an embryo to the government. The embryo became the boy Masato. Now, Hau Dragon has rebuilt the other 7 mecha and wants the 8th. It will be up to Masato and Himuro to pilot Zeorymer and fight against the Hau Dragon, but neither Masato or Himuro are all that they seem. \n\n(Source: AniDB)", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 220, "type": "anime", "name": "Youmex", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/220/Youmex"}, {"mal_id": 224, "type": "anime", "name": "Toshiba EMI", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/224/Toshiba_EMI"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 284, "type": "anime", "name": "Central Park Media", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/284/Central_Park_Media"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 48, "type": "anime", "name": "AIC", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/48/AIC"}, {"mal_id": 72, "type": "anime", "name": "Artmic", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/72/Artmic"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 18, "type": "anime", "name": "Mecha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}, {"mal_id": 40, "type": "anime", "name": "Psychological", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 55731, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/55731/Wu_Nao_Monu", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1386/136705.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1386/136705t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1386/136705l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1386/136705.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1386/136705t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1386/136705l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "qPmP8-0Pwuw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPmP8-0Pwuw", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/qPmP8-0Pwuw?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/qPmP8-0Pwuw/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/qPmP8-0Pwuw/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/qPmP8-0Pwuw/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/qPmP8-0Pwuw/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/qPmP8-0Pwuw/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Wu Nao Monu"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Brainless Witch"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u65e0\u8111\u9b54\u5973"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Agate"}], "title": "Wu Nao Monu", "title_english": "Agate", "title_japanese": "\u65e0\u8111\u9b54\u5973", "title_synonyms": ["Brainless Witch"], "type": "ONA", "source": "Web manga", "episodes": 15, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2023-07-04T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2023-10-03T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 4, "month": 7, "year": 2023}, "to": {"day": 3, "month": 10, "year": 2023}}, "string": "Jul 4, 2023 to Oct 3, 2023"}, "duration": "8 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 6.73, "scored_by": 1161, "rank": 5879, "popularity": 7692, "members": 7734, "favorites": 26, "synopsis": "Agate is a demon girl cursed with an eternal life.

Growing doubtful, he freed the fox spirit to save the girl. As a punishment for his transgression, Jiang Ziya was banished to the North Sea, with his divine power sealed, until he would no longer be plagued by the Nine-Tailed's mirage.\n\nTen years later, Jiang Ziya dwells in the North Sea alongside his friend Shen Gongbao and his pet Si Bu Xiang. At a bar, Jiang Ziya meets Xiao Jiu\u2014who resembles the girl from the illusion. When he asks her about the Nine-Tailed Fox Demon's bracelet on her ankle, she tells him that the accessory reveals to her a place where black flowers bloom. Conflicted over what to believe, Jiang Ziya accompanies Xiao Jiu to Mount Youdu. Thus, the two begin a formidable journey that might uncover not only the truth Jiang Ziya has been searching for, but also shocking facts about the great war of the past.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Jiang Ziya is loosely based on the Ming-dynasty Chinese novel Investiture of the Gods by Xu Zhonglin.

Caesar is immediately smitten and desires to rule Egypt with Cleopatra at his side\u2014but little does he know that she intends to assassinate him as soon as she can.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 467, "type": "anime", "name": "Discotek Media", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/467/Discotek_Media"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 68, "type": "anime", "name": "Mushi Production", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/68/Mushi_Production"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 13, "type": "anime", "name": "Historical", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 28169, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/28169/Buta_no_Gotoki_Sanzoku_ni_Torawarete_Shojo_wo_Ubawareru_Kyonyuu_Himekishi___Onna_Senshi", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1748/103894.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1748/103894t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1748/103894l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1748/103894.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1748/103894t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1748/103894l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Buta no Gotoki Sanzoku ni Torawarete Shojo wo Ubawareru Kyonyuu Himekishi & Onna Senshi"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Buta no Gotoki Sanzoku ni Torawarete Shojo wo Ubawareru Kyonyuu Himekishi & Onna Senshi: Zettai Chinpo Nanka ni Maketari Shinai!!

As music becomes their shared passion, it seems that Aya's feelings will remain unchanged\u2014even when Mitsuki's secret comes to light.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [], "licensors": [], "studios": [], "genres": [{"mal_id": 26, "type": "anime", "name": "Girls Love", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/26/Girls_Love"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 19, "type": "anime", "name": "Music", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/19/Music"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 55570, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/55570/Shin_Tennis_no_Oujisama__U-17_World_Cup_Semifinal", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1507/145670.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1507/145670t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1507/145670l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1507/145670.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1507/145670t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1507/145670l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "m7BcHk9tUiA", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7BcHk9tUiA", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/m7BcHk9tUiA?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/m7BcHk9tUiA/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/m7BcHk9tUiA/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/m7BcHk9tUiA/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/m7BcHk9tUiA/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/m7BcHk9tUiA/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Shin Tennis no Oujisama: U-17 World Cup Semifinal"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u65b0\u30c6\u30cb\u30b9\u306e\u738b\u5b50\u69d8 U-17 WORLD CUP SEMIFINAL"}, {"type": "English", "title": "The Prince of Tennis II U-17 World Cup Semifinal"}], "title": "Shin Tennis no Oujisama: U-17 World Cup Semifinal", "title_english": "The Prince of Tennis II U-17 World Cup Semifinal", "title_japanese": "\u65b0\u30c6\u30cb\u30b9\u306e\u738b\u5b50\u69d8 U-17 WORLD CUP SEMIFINAL", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "TV", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 13, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2024-10-03T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2024-12-26T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 3, "month": 10, "year": 2024}, "to": {"day": 26, "month": 12, "year": 2024}}, "string": "Oct 3, 2024 to Dec 26, 2024"}, "duration": "23 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 6.67, "scored_by": 1995, "rank": 6250, "popularity": 7762, "members": 7581, "favorites": 28, "synopsis": "After the intense quarterfinals, the U-17 World Cup competition has been whittled down to four formidable teams.

Although it was an existence far beyond human knowledge, it reminded Yuu of something warm and familiar.\n\nIt was Giant Gorg which is called \"Messenger of the God\" by the inhabitants of the island. Escaping from the attack of GAIL's assault team, Gorg guided Yuu into the underworld. There, he found alien's relic and an alien who woke up after 30,000 years' sleep.\n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 1984, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": "Unknown"}, "producers": [], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 467, "type": "anime", "name": "Discotek Media", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/467/Discotek_Media"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 14, "type": "anime", "name": "Sunrise", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/14/Sunrise"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 18, "type": "anime", "name": "Mecha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 34085, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/34085/Sakura_Nagashi", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/82037.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/82037t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/82037l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/82037.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/82037t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/82037l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Sakura Nagashi"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u685c\u6d41\u3057"}], "title": "Sakura Nagashi", "title_english": null, "title_japanese": "\u685c\u6d41\u3057", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "Music", "source": "Original", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2016-09-18T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 18, "month": 9, "year": 2016}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Sep 18, 2016"}, "duration": "4 min", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 6.96, "scored_by": 4071, "rank": null, "popularity": 7813, "members": 7472, "favorites": 13, "synopsis": "Singer Hikaru Utada's YouTube channel began streaming a music video for her song \"Sakura Nagashi,\" the theme song for Evangelion: 3.33 You Can (Not) Redo, set to scenes from the film.
