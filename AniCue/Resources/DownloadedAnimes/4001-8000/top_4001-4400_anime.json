The place: Edo, now known as Tokyo.\n\nOne of the highest populated cities in the world, teeming with peasants, samurai, townsmen, merchants, nobles, artists, courtesans, and perhaps even supernatural things.\n\nA much accomplished artist of his time and now in his mid-fifties, Tetsuzo can boast clients from all over Japan, and tirelessly works in the garbage-loaded chaos of his house-atelier. He spends his days creating astounding pieces of art, from a giant-size Bodhidharma portrayed on a 180 square meter-wide sheet of paper, to a pair of sparrows painted on a tiny rice grain. Short-tempered, utterly sarcastic, with no passion for sake or money, he would charge a fortune for any job he is not really interested in.\n\nThird of Tetsuzo's four daughters and born out of his second marriage, outspoken 23-year-old O-Ei has inherited her father's talent and stubbornness, and very often she would paint instead of him, though uncredited. Her art is so powerful that sometimes leads to trouble. \"We're father and daughter; with two brushes and four chopsticks, I guess we can always manage, in a way or another.\"\n\nDecades later, Europe was going to discover the immense talent of Tetsuzo. He was to become best known by one of his many names: Katsushika Hokusai. He would mesmerize Renoir and van Gogh, Monet and Klimt.\n\nHowever, very few today are even aware of the woman who assisted him all his life, and greatly contributed to his art while remaining uncredited. This is the untold story of O-Ei, Master Hokusai's daughter: a lively portrayal of a free-spirited woman overshadowed by her larger-than-life father, unfolding through the changing seasons.\n\n(Source: Production I.G)", "background": "The film won the Jury Award at the 39th Annecy International Animated Film Festival.

But she is not the only customer; a cocky mage and a drastically overworked yet underpaid sage become regulars as well.\n\nThe knight brings trouble to the diner at times, but Dennis's cooking skills and beloved butcher knives cut through trouble and hunger alike!\n\nThus begins the legend of Dennis and his diner, the talk of the town!\n\n(Source: Tentai Books)", "background": "", "season": "summer", "year": 2025, "broadcast": {"day": "Thursdays", "time": "22:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Thursdays at 22:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 146, "type": "anime", "name": "CBC Television", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/146/CBC_Television"}, {"mal_id": 238, "type": "anime", "name": "AT-X", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"}, {"mal_id": 460, "type": "anime", "name": "KlockWorx", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/460/KlockWorx"}, {"mal_id": 1211, "type": "anime", "name": "Tokyo MX", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1211/Tokyo_MX"}, {"mal_id": 1284, "type": "anime", "name": "Avex Pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1284/Avex_Pictures"}, {"mal_id": 1416, "type": "anime", "name": "BS11", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1416/BS11"}, {"mal_id": 1443, "type": "anime", "name": "Overlap", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1443/Overlap"}, {"mal_id": 1996, "type": "anime", "name": "MAGNET", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1996/MAGNET"}, {"mal_id": 2074, "type": "anime", "name": "Bit grooove promotion", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2074/Bit_grooove_promotion"}, {"mal_id": 2999, "type": "anime", "name": "Hike", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2999/Hike"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 28, "type": "anime", "name": "OLM", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/28/OLM"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 47, "type": "anime", "name": "Gourmet", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/47/Gourmet"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 49521, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/49521/Non_Non_Biyori_Nonstop__Bukatsu_wo_Ganbatta", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1984/120788.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1984/120788t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1984/120788l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1984/120788.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1984/120788t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1984/120788l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Non Non Biyori Nonstop: Bukatsu wo Ganbatta"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Non Non Biyori Nonstop Episode 13"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Non Non Biyori Nonstop OVA"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u306e\u3093\u306e\u3093\u3073\u3088\u308a \u306e\u3093\u3059\u3068\u3063\u3077 \u90e8\u6d3b\u3092\u304c\u3093\u3070\u3063\u305f"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Non Non Biyori Nonstop: Our Club Worked Hard"}], "title": "Non Non Biyori Nonstop: Bukatsu wo Ganbatta", "title_english": "Non Non Biyori Nonstop: Our Club Worked Hard", "title_japanese": "\u306e\u3093\u306e\u3093\u3073\u3088\u308a \u306e\u3093\u3059\u3068\u3063\u3077 \u90e8\u6d3b\u3092\u304c\u3093\u3070\u3063\u305f", "title_synonyms": ["Non Non Biyori Nonstop Episode 13", "Non Non Biyori Nonstop OVA"], "type": "OVA", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2022-03-23T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 23, "month": 3, "year": 2022}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Mar 23, 2022"}, "duration": "22 min", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 8.15, "scored_by": 11858, "rank": 482, "popularity": 4025, "members": 37250, "favorites": 31, "synopsis": "Beginning her academic journey as a first grader, Shiori comes face to face with the aspect of school she has heard alarming rumors about\u2014homework!

The city uses the very pollution that caused the disaster as an energy source.\n\nHowever, although the initial plan was successful to an extent, it didn't just create a new source of energy, but also an elite group of people. This prestigious faction believes that they are above the system, and are not willing to accept survivors from outside the city unless they are put to work as laborers.\n\nAmong the people living in the wasteland outside Ecoban is a young man named Shua. He leads a very difficult life, but tries to make the most of it through the love that he feels for his childhood friend Jay. Unfortunately, Jay may be more interested in her security commander Cade than in Shua, and thus a love triangle is formed. Not only does Shua have to deal with the heartbreak, but he must also find a new way to survive in the crumbles left from the once-beautiful planet Earth.", "background": "During the production of Wonderful Days, one of two available prototypes of the Frazier lens was used during filming.

After only the first couple of practices, Daigo's lack of talent and inherent baseball sense shows, and his confidence is crushed. Unable to bear the pressure of living up to his father, a baseball prodigy, he quits the team in less than a year.\n\nTwo years later, now in sixth-grade, a transfer student joins Daigo's class.

Filled with determination to be with Seiji, she declares that she will also become an idol.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 2006, "broadcast": {"day": "Fridays", "time": "18:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Fridays at 18:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 135, "type": "anime", "name": "MediaNet", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/135/MediaNet"}, {"mal_id": 757, "type": "anime", "name": "Sony Music Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/757/Sony_Music_Entertainment"}, {"mal_id": 3087, "type": "anime", "name": "Shogakukan Productions", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/3087/Shogakukan_Productions"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 118, "type": "anime", "name": "SynergySP", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/118/SynergySP"}, {"mal_id": 131, "type": "anime", "name": "G&G Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/131/G_G_Entertainment"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 75, "type": "anime", "name": "Showbiz", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/75/Showbiz"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 25, "type": "anime", "name": "Shoujo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo"}]}, {"mal_id": 34430, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/34430/Meitantei_Conan_Movie_21__Karakurenai_no_Love_Letter", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/83919.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/83919t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/83919l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/83919.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/83919t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/83919l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "d44tuuPbAw8", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d44tuuPbAw8", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/d44tuuPbAw8?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/d44tuuPbAw8/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/d44tuuPbAw8/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/d44tuuPbAw8/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/d44tuuPbAw8/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/d44tuuPbAw8/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Meitantei Conan Movie 21: Karakurenai no Love Letter"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u5287\u5834\u7248\u300e\u540d\u63a2\u5075\u30b3\u30ca\u30f3 \u304b\u3089\u7d05\u306e\u604b\u6b4c\u300f"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Detective Conan Movie 21: The Crimson Love Letter"}, {"type": "German", "title": "Detektiv Conan FIlm 21: Der purpurrote Liebesbrief"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "Detective Conan Pel\u00edcula 21: La Carta de Amor escarlata"}, {"type": "French", "title": "Detective Conan Film 21: La Lettre d'Amour Ecarlate"}], "title": "Meitantei Conan Movie 21: Karakurenai no Love Letter", "title_english": "Detective Conan Movie 21: The Crimson Love Letter", "title_japanese": "\u5287\u5834\u7248\u300e\u540d\u63a2\u5075\u30b3\u30ca\u30f3 \u304b\u3089\u7d05\u306e\u604b\u6b4c\u300f", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "Movie", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2017-04-15T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 15, "month": 4, "year": 2017}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Apr 15, 2017"}, "duration": "1 hr 51 min", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.68, "scored_by": 18897, "rank": 1389, "popularity": 4161, "members": 34913, "favorites": 43, "synopsis": "A bombing case at Nichiuri TV in autumn.

Kadode Koyama and Ouran Nakagawa live their final days like they always have: going to school, playing with friends, and doing what any carefree high school girl would do.\n\nAs they grow up, they come to learn what it truly means to be an adult, in a world where adults seem to be demons who only deceive and destroy. They come to learn the real threat to humanity is not the Invaders, but humanity itself.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 470, "type": "anime", "name": "GAGA", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/470/GAGA"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 2157, "type": "anime", "name": "Production +h.", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2157/Production__h"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 42, "type": "anime", "name": "Seinen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]}, {"mal_id": 1695, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/1695/Les_Mis\u00e9rables__Shoujo_Cosette", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1/1695.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1/1695t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1/1695l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1/1695.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1/1695t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1/1695l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Les Mis\u00e9rables: Shoujo Cosette"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Les Miserables: Shoujo Cosette"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30ec\u30fb\u30df\u30bc\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb \u5c11\u5973\u30b3\u30bc\u30c3\u30c8"}], "title": "Les Mis\u00e9rables: Shoujo Cosette", "title_english": null, "title_japanese": "\u30ec\u30fb\u30df\u30bc\u30e9\u30d6\u30eb \u5c11\u5973\u30b3\u30bc\u30c3\u30c8", "title_synonyms": ["Les Miserables: Shoujo Cosette"], "type": "TV", "source": "Novel", "episodes": 52, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2007-01-07T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2007-12-30T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 7, "month": 1, "year": 2007}, "to": {"day": 30, "month": 12, "year": 2007}}, "string": "Jan 7, 2007 to Dec 30, 2007"}, "duration": "24 min per ep", "rating": "G - All Ages", "score": 7.91, "scored_by": 10625, "rank": 842, "popularity": 4247, "members": 33447, "favorites": 305, "synopsis": "In 19th century France, a struggling single mother, Fantine, leaves her three-year-old daughter Cosette in the care of her new acquaintances, the Thernadiers.

Yuuno is not powerful enough to capture the Jewel seeds on his own, so he grants Nanoha the intelligent device \"Raising Heart\" and begins training her as a mage.  \n\nUnfortunately, the powerful Jewel Seeds attract those with ill intentions. Another mage, Fate Testarossa, is desperate to collect the seeds for some unknown and sinister purpose, though the solemn look in her eyes makes Nanoha think that there is more to Fate than meets the eye.

Wielding the belt's unparalleled power, he repelled the Shadow Lord's attempt to overthrow the kingdom. Adin was crowned king of Deltora, but he never forgot that the enemy remained unbeaten. \n\nCenturies later, memory of the Shadow Lord has become faded and almost forgotten, and the people of Deltora see their monarchy as detached and uncaring. Much to their dismay, the Shadow Lord strikes once more, breaking the Belt of Deltora by scattering the seven gems across the continent. Jarred, a close friend of the young king Endon, assists him and his wife in escaping from the castle as the Shadow Lord takes over, and they part ways to go into hiding.\n\nThe Shadow Lord now reigns over Deltora and many years pass under his tyrannical rule. However, there is a glimmer of hope in Jarred's son Lief, whom he has lovingly raised and trained to find the scattered gemstones and reassemble the Belt of Deltora. Along with his companions Barda and Jasmine, Lief must face devious enemies and dangerous beasts to oust the Shadow Lord and return peace to Deltora.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Deltora Quest is based on Australian author Emily Rodda's book series of the same title.
