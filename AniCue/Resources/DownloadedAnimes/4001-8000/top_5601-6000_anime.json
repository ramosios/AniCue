Gokudou does get his wishes, though not exactly in the fashion that he expected. The best thing he gets out of his wishes is Honou no Maken, a magical sword that enables its owner to do fire attacks and it can be summoned from anywhere in the world.\n\nEven with an enchanted sword, Gokudou doesn't get much respect. He gets turned into a woman by Djinn, who is also a shapeshifter. He is followed by Rubette La Late, a potential love interest who is more interested in adventure, karaoke and outperforming Gokudou. He gets whapped on the head a lot, especially by the fortuneteller who reappears throughout the series just to plague Gokudou it seems. Later in the series, he gets another sidekick, a former evil magician named Prince, who is more handsome and a better womanizer than Gokudou.\n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 1999, "broadcast": {"day": "Fridays", "time": "18:30", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Fridays at 18:30 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 153, "type": "anime", "name": "SoftX", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/153/SoftX"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 250, "type": "anime", "name": "Media Blasters", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/250/Media_Blasters"}, {"mal_id": 467, "type": "anime", "name": "Discotek Media", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/467/Discotek_Media"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 80, "type": "anime", "name": "Trans Arts", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/80/Trans_Arts"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 1637, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/1637/Kaze_to_Ki_no_Uta_Sanctus__Sei_Naru_Kana", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/33835.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/33835t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/33835l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/33835.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/33835t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/33835l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Kaze to Ki no Uta Sanctus: Sei Naru Kana"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "The Song of the Wind and the Trees"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Kaze To Ki No Uta: Sei Ni Naru Ka Na"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "KazeKi"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u98a8\u3068\u6728\u306e\u8a69\u3000\uff33\uff21\uff2e\uff23\uff34\uff35\uff33\uff0d\u8056\u306a\u308b\u304b\u306a\uff0d"}, {"type": "English", "title": "The Poem of Wind and Trees"}], "title": "Kaze to Ki no Uta Sanctus: Sei Naru Kana", "title_english": "The Poem of Wind and Trees", "title_japanese": "\u98a8\u3068\u6728\u306e\u8a69\u3000\uff33\uff21\uff2e\uff23\uff34\uff35\uff33\uff0d\u8056\u306a\u308b\u304b\u306a\uff0d", "title_synonyms": ["The Song of the Wind and the Trees", "Kaze To Ki No Uta: Sei Ni Naru Ka Na", "KazeKi"], "type": "OVA", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "1987-11-06T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 6, "month": 11, "year": 1987}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Nov 6, 1987"}, "duration": "59 min", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 6.85, "scored_by": 7698, "rank": 5186, "popularity": 5626, "members": 16945, "favorites": 121, "synopsis": "1887, at a remote, elite boarding school in France: Serge Battour returns after his graduation, and remembers the days of his youth...\n\n1880, at the same school: Son of a viscount and a Roma prostitute (both deceased), Serge is intelligent, sweet, talented, and alienated by his family due to his heritage.

This man, Rikurou Tachibana, was about to end up sold to slavers, but instead, he wound up in the eternal service of Annerose\u2014something her other servent, Mitico didn't take too kindly to. Rikurou doesn't know what's worse, Mitico being able to chop him up into tiny pieces, only to be resurrected, or having to deal with the intense sexual frustration of living with Annerose.\n\nBoth of these problems get set aside, however, when Annerose and her servants take on a case involving a girl named Miki and her missing brother.

The size and shape of the resulting product seem to be different depending on the kinds of feelings that the life possesses. When Hajiki comes in contact with one by accident, it transforms into a huge robot\u2014a Tekkoudo, or \"Iron Giant\"\u2014which Hajiki names Lightning. And soon he realizes that he isn't the only one with a Tekkoudo, and must find out how to deal with those others who he feels are the \"same\" as himself.\n\n(Source: ANN)", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 2003, "broadcast": {"day": "Thursdays", "time": "02:58", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Thursdays at 02:58 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 34, "type": "anime", "name": "HAL Film Maker", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/34/HAL_Film_Maker"}, {"mal_id": 108, "type": "anime", "name": "Media Factory", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/108/Media_Factory"}, {"mal_id": 170, "type": "anime", "name": "Imagica", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/170/Imagica"}, {"mal_id": 827, "type": "anime", "name": "Amber Film Works", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/827/Amber_Film_Works"}, {"mal_id": 2135, "type": "anime", "name": "Imagine", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2135/Imagine"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}, {"mal_id": 1459, "type": "anime", "name": "Geneon Entertainment USA", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1459/Geneon_Entertainment_USA"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 3, "type": "anime", "name": "Gonzo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/3/Gonzo"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 18, "type": "anime", "name": "Mecha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 1126, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/1126/Figure_17__Tsubasa___Hikaru", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1862/133787.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1862/133787t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1862/133787l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1862/133787.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1862/133787t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1862/133787l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "55x6wjzqM50", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55x6wjzqM50", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/55x6wjzqM50?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/55x6wjzqM50/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/55x6wjzqM50/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/55x6wjzqM50/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/55x6wjzqM50/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/55x6wjzqM50/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Figure 17: Tsubasa & Hikaru"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Figure 17 - Tsubasa and Hikaru"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30d5\u30a3\u30ae\u30e5\u30a217 \u3064\u3070\u3055&\u30d2\u30ab\u30eb"}, {"type": "French", "title": "Figure 17"}], "title": "Figure 17: Tsubasa & Hikaru", "title_english": null, "title_japanese": "\u30d5\u30a3\u30ae\u30e5\u30a217 \u3064\u3070\u3055&\u30d2\u30ab\u30eb", "title_synonyms": ["Figure 17 - Tsubasa and Hikaru"], "type": "TV", "source": "Original", "episodes": 13, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2001-05-27T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2002-05-26T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 27, "month": 5, "year": 2001}, "to": {"day": 26, "month": 5, "year": 2002}}, "string": "May 27, 2001 to May 26, 2002"}, "duration": "47 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.19, "scored_by": 4034, "rank": 3495, "popularity": 5835, "members": 15423, "favorites": 85, "synopsis": "Tsubasa Shiina is a 10-year-old girl who recently moved to Hokkaido to live with her father.

Kumiho are familiar figures in Korean folk tales, and they are usually depicted as magical creatures that take female form to lure and prey on humans. This time, however, our protagonist is a young, kind-hearted fox with only five tails, instead of nine.\n\nAfter losing her family to fox hunters, five-tailed Yobi lives in the forest with some shipwrecked aliens, far away from the humans. When one of her alien friends gets captured by a villager, Yobi has no choice but to adventure into the human world to rescue him. At the village, Yobi meets many humans, including Geum Yee who studies at a school for maladjusted children. Interested in Geum Yee, Yobi joins the students and revels in the fun of human life, but both a fox hunter and a mysterious shadow man are on her trail.\n\n(Source: YesAsia)", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 308, "type": "anime", "name": "Yellow Film", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/308/Yellow_Film"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 307, "type": "anime", "name": "Sunwoo Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/307/Sunwoo_Entertainment"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 57369, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/57369/Paripi_Koumei__Road_to_Summer_Sonia", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1465/140538.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1465/140538t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1465/140538l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1465/140538.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1465/140538t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1465/140538l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "HFK_dk35TEM", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFK_dk35TEM", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/HFK_dk35TEM?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/HFK_dk35TEM/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/HFK_dk35TEM/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/HFK_dk35TEM/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/HFK_dk35TEM/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/HFK_dk35TEM/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Paripi Koumei: Road to Summer Sonia"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30d1\u30ea\u30d4\u5b54\u660e Road to Summer Sonia"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Ya Boy Kongming!

She performs as an idol like Kokona Saionji (her classmate and close friend) and Tsubasa Kisaragi (an idol who dresses in male clothing). However, unlike Kokona whose popularity is skyrocketing and Tsubasa with her charisma in male attire, Komugi's only gigs are low-end ones like those at the local shopping district. Still, Komugi has her \"dream\" as she lives her dual lives as a idol and a middle school girl.\n\nOne day, a mysterious injured creature named Usa-P appears before Komugi. Komugi gives Usa-P medical treatment, and Usa-P, in consideration of Komugi's kindness, asks if she wants to be a Legendary Girl who can use magical powers.\n\nHaving become a reluctant Legendary Girl, Komugi battles strange masked figures who suddenly appear!

Although these creatures are free to roam the world in their original form, the magicians sometimes turn them into charms so that they can be carried around with great ease. Most Jewelpets don't find this troublesome, but once a mischievous bunny by the name of Ruby feels overly claustrophobic, she devises her escape.\n\nOne day, the magicians decide to move the Jewelpets, and task a pelican with delivering them to the Dream Forest. All is well until a strong gust of wind disorients the bird, who then drops all of the charms that he was carrying. Instead of heading towards the Dream Forest, all the Jewelpets but Ruby fall to Rinko's home city on Earth. Someone must go and retrieve them all, and as Ruby was the worst-behaved of the bunch, she is given the task of going to Earth.\n\nWhen Ruby reaches Earth in the form of a red Jewel Charm, she falls into Rinko's water glass, and thus begins a rather unexpected adventure. Rinko, Minami, and Ruby form an alliance to search and gather all of the fallen charms, encountering strange creatures and tons of helpful allies along the way.

It was broadcast by Fuji Television and reached over 40 percent viewership rating by the following year. The February 2004 issue of the Cinefantastique American magazine listed it as one of the 10 Essential Anime. It ranked second in the 100 Select Works of Media Arts survey for the animation category, which was held in 2006 by the Japan Media Arts Festival. The series also won several awards: the Special Award at the second Television Reporters Conference in 1964, The Ministry of Health and Welfare Award in 1965, and the Galaxy Award at the fourth Broadcast Critics' Discussion in 1967. When television producer Fred Ladd helped NBC Enterprises adapt the series for broadcast in the United States in 1963, the title Astro Boy was used instead of the manga's English title Mighty Atom.
