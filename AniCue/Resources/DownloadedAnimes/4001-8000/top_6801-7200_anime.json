The manga on which it is based is one of the much-read works produced for adolescent Japanese girls that features a healthy proportion of gay men and beautiful teenagers aka bishounen (beautiful boys). Most of the action takes place in Marinera, the land of eternal spring, located somewhere in the South Seas. The country is a major producer of diamonds; they provide much of the basis of conflict in the anime series. They come from one of the most prolific mines in the world, owned by the king of Marinera, the vertically challenged but horizontally endowed boy-king Patarillo himself. The International Diamond Syndicate - a huge semi- criminal organization/ secret society dedicated to taking over the world's entire diamond supply- wants that mine and will stop at nothing to get it. In the early episodes they send off a number of bishounen assassins to do in Patarillo, which necessitates his having a bodyguard, the English MI6 agent, Major Jack ('Bishounen-Killer') Bancoran. Bancoran's nickname doesn't mean he shoots bishounen in cold blood. The soubriquet comes from the fact that no male under the age of 17 can resist his sexual fascination. This, to Bancoran's eternal disgust, includes Patarillo himself. The action switches often from Marinera to MI6 headquarters in London (London seems to be an easy two hour's flight from the South Seas) or Bancoran's palatial condo in the suburbs of same. (MI6, be it noted, looks a lot like Fritz Lang's Metropolis, while Jack's 'apartment' bears a passing resemblance to Randolph Hearst's spread.) The action also goes into the past and future and out into space.

This leaves him vulnerable in a city where nearly everyone makes decisions that only benefit themselves as individuals. Hokuto hopes that if Subaru develops feelings for Seishirou, their relationship will be the one thing that he never gives up for the sake of anyone else.

It is now up to Saiga and guardian Reideen to fight against this unknown alien threat from the sky.\n\n(Source: ANN)", "background": "", "season": "winter", "year": 2007, "broadcast": {"day": "Saturdays", "time": "19:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Saturdays at 19:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 577, "type": "anime", "name": "Tohokushinsha Film Corporation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/577/Tohokushinsha_Film_Corporation"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 376, "type": "anime", "name": "Sentai Filmworks", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Production I.G", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 18, "type": "anime", "name": "Mecha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 2543, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/2543/Robin_Hood_no_Daibouken", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1050/147718.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1050/147718t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1050/147718l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1050/147718.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1050/147718t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1050/147718l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Robin Hood no Daibouken"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30ed\u30d3\u30f3\u30d5\u30c3\u30c9\u306e\u5927\u5192\u967a"}, {"type": "English", "title": "The Great Adventures of Robin Hood"}, {"type": "German", "title": "Robin Hood"}, {"type": "French", "title": "Les Aventures de Robin des Bois"}], "title": "Robin Hood no Daibouken", "title_english": "The Great Adventures of Robin Hood", "title_japanese": "\u30ed\u30d3\u30f3\u30d5\u30c3\u30c9\u306e\u5927\u5192\u967a", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "TV", "source": "Unknown", "episodes": 52, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "1990-07-29T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "1992-10-28T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 29, "month": 7, "year": 1990}, "to": {"day": 28, "month": 10, "year": 1992}}, "string": "Jul 29, 1990 to Oct 28, 1992"}, "duration": "25 min per ep", "rating": "G - All Ages", "score": 7.11, "scored_by": 4542, "rank": 3961, "popularity": 6963, "members": 10016, "favorites": 36, "synopsis": "A variant of Robin Hood in which all the principal characters are teenagers.\n\nSeveral centuries ago in Nottingham County, a cruel and greedy baron by the name of Alwine ordered the destruction of the Huntingtons' castle\u2014from the fire of which Robin and his cousins, Will, Winifred and Barbara, miraculously escaped. The youngsters sought shelter in Sherwood Forest, where, thanks to the wise guidance of the hermit better known as \"Friar Tuck,\" they managed to face the difficulties of a life in the wilderness as as well as they could; however, in the forest there lived a fearless group of young bandits, led by Little John. Their first encounter with Robin and his cousins was at first rather stormy, as the two groups fought for the destiny of a young, noble maiden named Marian who had fallen into the hands of the bandits during an ambush.\n\nTheir bitterness, however, rapidly lead the way to friendship, and Robin and John later realized they were all victims of the same fate. The youngsters thus mutually decided to help one another. Baron Alwine was not merely enemy of the Huntingtons\u2014in fact, a couple years earlier he had forced Little John and his gang to seek protection in the forest to avoid forced labour. He would later seek Marian Lancaster for the secret carved on a cross the girl wore as symbol of her family line.\n\nThe girl was to be adopted by the shady Bishop Herfort\u2014Alwine's accomplice\u2014who sought to attain the Lancaster's wealth. With all their strength, Robin and his friends were then compelled to fight against the baron's troops, led by Gilbert\u2014a dangerous and fearless knight. When Winifred and Marian were then imprisoned in the castle's dungeons, our heroes tried in every way possible to enter until their ardour was finally rewarded with success. Thanks to his noble heart and heed for danger, Robin became rapidly known as the protector of the poor and oppressed. Beloved and highly esteemed not only by the villagers, but also and especially by the sweet and beautiful Marian he was. The boy who never parted from his loyal, magical bow, endlessly engaged in dangerous and unthinkable missions.", "background": "", "season": "summer", "year": 1990, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": "Unknown"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 111, "type": "anime", "name": "NHK", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/111/NHK"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 103, "type": "anime", "name": "Tatsunoko Production", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/103/Tatsunoko_Production"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 13, "type": "anime", "name": "Historical", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 36798, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/36798/Yuuki_Yuuna_wa_Yuusha_de_Aru__Hidamari", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/89061.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/89061t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/89061l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/89061.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/89061t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/89061l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru: Hidamari"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u7d50\u57ce\u53cb\u5948\u306f\u52c7\u8005\u3067\u3042\u308b \u7dcf\u96c6\u7de8\u300c\u3072\u3060\u307e\u308a\u300d"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Yuki Yuna is a Hero: A Sunny Place"}], "title": "Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru: Hidamari", "title_english": "Yuki Yuna is a Hero: A Sunny Place", "title_japanese": "\u7d50\u57ce\u53cb\u5948\u306f\u52c7\u8005\u3067\u3042\u308b \u7dcf\u96c6\u7de8\u300c\u3072\u3060\u307e\u308a\u300d", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "Special", "source": "Original", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2017-11-18T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 18, "month": 11, "year": 2017}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Nov 18, 2017"}, "duration": "24 min", "rating": "PG-13 -

In the end, Eureka and Renton must part ways, but Renton vows that they will meet again someday, no matter what. \n\nEpisode 51 has absolutely no relation to Eureka Seven's sequel \"Eureka Seven AO\", as this was a real ending that was not used for the original TV run of the series.

As the game progresses and the sexual tension escalates, it culminates in a sexual free-for-all with his stepmother and stepsister. \n\n(Source: Boxtorrents)", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 206, "type": "anime", "name": "Digital Works", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/206/Digital_Works"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 250, "type": "anime", "name": "Media Blasters", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/250/Media_Blasters"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 239, "type": "anime", "name": "Y.O.U.C", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/239/YOUC"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 12, "type": "anime", "name": "Hentai", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/12/Hentai"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 5651, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/5651/Helter_Skelter__Hakudaku_no_Mura", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/86049.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/86049t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/86049l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/86049.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/86049t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/86049l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Helter Skelter: Hakudaku no Mura"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30d8\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u30b9\u30b1\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc \uff5e\u767d\u6fc1\u306e\u6751\uff5e"}], "title": "Helter Skelter: Hakudaku no Mura", "title_english": null, "title_japanese": "\u30d8\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u30b9\u30b1\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc \uff5e\u767d\u6fc1\u306e\u6751\uff5e", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "OVA", "source": "Visual novel", "episodes": 4, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2009-01-30T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2014-11-28T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 30, "month": 1, "year": 2009}, "to": {"day": 28, "month": 11, "year": 2014}}, "string": "Jan 30, 2009 to Nov 28, 2014"}, "duration": "28 min per ep", "rating": "Rx - Hentai", "score": 6.66, "scored_by": 3383, "rank": null, "popularity": 7153, "members": 9328, "favorites": 72, "synopsis": "Miu and her family of four women are well-known in the media for being aspiring young celebrities.
