Hirono, bewildered by the event, none-the-less takes the girl to his home to recuperate (this is his duty as a \"Hero of Justice\"). He also keeps the \"Dream Note\" so that he can transpose his favorite \"Wing Man\" costume designs into it.\n\nLater, Hirono is confronted by the girl who reveals herself to be Yume Aoi, Princess of the Dreamscape called Botoreem. Her domain has been conquered by the power mad despot, Rimeru and his armies of monstrous \"Seed Men.\" She barely escaped her domain with the power artifact known as the \"Dream Note.\" The \"Dream Note\" enables its possessor to create anything they desire by merely drawing or writing information within its pages. Rimeru seeks to steal it to become Master of the Universe. She demands that Hirono give her back the book, but Hirono had already begun drawing into the book (mystically linking himself to it).\n\nHirono soon discovers that his designs and notes on Wing Man become reality and he in turn becomes his own creation. Using these powers and abilities, he and Aoi begin their strange and amazing adventure. Along the way, Hirono inadvertently involves all of his friends, especially Miku in his quest to help Aoi free her people and save her father.\n\nRimeru sends his various minions to Earth's dimension to retrieve the book. One his henchmen is the noble yet devious Kitakura who goes as far as infiltrating Hirono's junior high school masquerading as a teacher.\n\n(Source: AniDB)", "background": "", "season": "winter", "year": 1984, "broadcast": {"day": "Tuesdays", "time": "19:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Tuesdays at 19:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 55, "type": "anime", "name": "TV Asahi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/55/TV_Asahi"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 18, "type": "anime", "name": "Toei Animation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/18/Toei_Animation"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}, {"mal_id": 31, "type": "anime", "name": "Super Power", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/31/Super_Power"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]}, {"mal_id": 9035, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/9035/Lupin_the_Third_x_Monkey_Majik", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/88095.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/88095t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/88095l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/88095.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/88095t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/88095l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Lupin the Third x Monkey Majik"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Lupin III"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Monkey Majik"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "Lupin The Third"}], "title": "Lupin the Third x Monkey Majik", "title_english": null, "title_japanese": "Lupin The Third", "title_synonyms": ["Lupin III", "Monkey Majik"], "type": "Music", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2009-08-26T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 26, "month": 8, "year": 2009}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Aug 26, 2009"}, "duration": "3 min", "rating": "PG-13 -

After an intense back and forth from both sides, the fate of Seishun's advancement in the competition rests on the shoulders of their team captain. Refusing to let Hyoutei be defeated this early in the tournament, Atobe is determined to defeat Tezuka by exposing and exploiting his weakness.\n\nInui-Kaidou vs. Shishido-Ootori / Oishi-Kikumaru vs. Niou-Yagyuu\nEmboldened by their invigorated efforts, Sadaharu Inui and Kaoru Kaidou compete with Hyoutei's Ryou Shishido and Choutarou Ootori as Seishun's newly formed doubles pair. Prior to the match, Inui proposes to Kaidou that they team up in order to elevate their playstyle and go beyond what they are currently capable of. Meanwhile, Shishido, who had just managed to get back onto the regular team, is resolved to prove that he deserves his position and must win no matter the cost.\n\nKnown as Seishun's \"Golden Pair,\" Eiji Kikumaru and Shuichiro Oishi face off against Rikkai University-Affiliated Middle School's Masaharu Niou and Hiroshi Yagyuu at the Kanto Regional Finals. While the game starts off smoothly for Seishun, Niou and Yagyuu begin to employ various strategies that make the game progressively harder to win. As the Golden Pair struggle against their opponents, the history behind the duo begins to unfold.\n\nFuji vs. Kirihara\nIn the Singles 2 event at the Kanto Regional finals, Seishun's \"Genius\" Shuusuke Fuji contends with Rikkai's second-year ace Akaya Kirihara. Kirihara boldly declares he will win the match within 13 minutes, a statement which Fuji cannot help but scoff at. As the match begins to draw out longer than anticipated, Kirihara resorts to a more violent playstyle. Backed into a corner, Fuji must quickly adapt if he wants to claim victory over Kirihara.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "In celebration of the 20th anniversary of the Tennis no Oujisama franchise, three of the most popular matchups in the series, as voted by fans, were reanimated.

While Japanese refugees were taken in by various countries, the Japanese government accepted aid from China and the United States, which eventually caused China to govern the North, and the USA to govern the South. 15 years later, the Japanese refugees residing in Taiwan and the Taiwanese citizens find themselves clashing with one another, due to job competition and the unimproving conditions of the Japanese refugees. Genichiro Ryu is a survivor of the catastrophic events that took place in Japan, but was raised in Taiwan by a couple who adopted him.

As is the case with all the older SD productions, SD Gundam Gaiden isn't available in the U.S.\n\n(Source: AniDB)", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 230, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/230/Bandai"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 14, "type": "anime", "name": "Sunrise", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/14/Sunrise"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 18, "type": "anime", "name": "Mecha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 50462, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/50462/Jiyi_Guanli_Ju", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1297/119667.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1297/119667t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1297/119667l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1297/119667.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1297/119667t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1297/119667l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Jiyi Guanli Ju"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7ba1\u7406\u5c40"}, {"type": "English", "title": "False Memory"}], "title": "Jiyi Guanli Ju", "title_english": "False Memory", "title_japanese": "\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7ba1\u7406\u5c40", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "ONA", "source": "Original", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2020-09-30T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 30, "month": 9, "year": 2020}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Sep 30, 2020"}, "duration": "18 min", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.41, "scored_by": 905, "rank": 2386, "popularity": 10247, "members": 3558, "favorites": 22, "synopsis": "In order to go back to the past, Guan Chao tries hard to find the \"burning stone\" that activates the time gun, but accidentally falls into the Memory Management Bureau.

Kimba was an adult, with Kitty as his mate, and they had two cubs. Most of all this series was the story of Rune, the male cub, as he grew and learned to be as strong as his father.\n\nFor legal reasons, the producers of the English-dubbed version could not use the name Kimba, so they used the original Japanese names for all the characters.\n\n(Source: Official Website)", "background": "", "season": "fall", "year": 1966, "broadcast": {"day": "Wednesdays", "time": "19:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Wednesdays at 19:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 68, "type": "anime", "name": "Mushi Production", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/68/Mushi_Production"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]}, {"mal_id": 1059, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/1059/Mutant_Turtles__Choujin_Densetsu-hen", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/44255.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/44255t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/44255l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/44255.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/44255t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/44255l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Mutant Turtles: Choujin Densetsu-hen"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Mutant Turtles: Superman Legend"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Legend of the Supermutants"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "TMNT"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8 \u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb\u30ba \u8d85\u4eba\u4f1d\u8aac\u7de8"}], "title": "Mutant Turtles: Choujin Densetsu-hen", "title_english": null, "title_japanese": "\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8 \u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb\u30ba \u8d85\u4eba\u4f1d\u8aac\u7de8", "title_synonyms": ["Mutant Turtles: Superman Legend", "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Legend of the Supermutants", "TMNT"], "type": "OVA", "source": "Other", "episodes": 2, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "1996-05-21T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 21, "month": 5, "year": 1996}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "May 21, 1996"}, "duration": "28 min per ep", "rating": "G - All Ages", "score": 5.24, "scored_by": 1670, "rank": 13201, "popularity": 10317, "members": 3486, "favorites": 12, "synopsis": "When the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles acquire Mutastones from Crys-Mu, the spirit of light, they acquire the ability to enhance themselves into Super Turtles for a duration of three minutes.
