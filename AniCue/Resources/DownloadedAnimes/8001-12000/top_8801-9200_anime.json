The movie features iconic characters of Tezuka's various works, with certain designs such as the Phoenix's having at least three renditions. The methods employed for special effects in the movie include scan camera shots, CGI, live-action filming, \"2-frame photography,\" 3D manipulation, rotoscoping, and more. Re-titled Space Firebird, the anime was one of the most widely distributed of the videos that have found their way into the Bargain Bin. The English version was first seen on US television in 1982, but was cut down by 20 minutes. A few months later, it was released in the UK on VHS & Betamax by Mountain Video in the same format and widely publicized. However, the video disappeared from store shelves two years later and was never re-released by another distributor. In the US, it was issued as VHS only in 1987 from the popular Celebrity Just For Kids. While the dub was the same, the movie was 10 minutes shorter, omitting some sundry scenes and the end credits. In 1980, Hi no Tori 2772: Ai no CosmoZone won the Inkpot Award at the San Diego Comic Convention and the Animation Award at the first Las Vegas Film Festival. It was also nominated at the Saturn Awards for the best animated movie category in 1983.", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 245, "type": "anime", "name": "TOHO", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/245/TOHO"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 200, "type": "anime", "name": "Tezuka Productions", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/200/Tezuka_Productions"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 29, "type": "anime", "name": "Space", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/29/Space"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 45658, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/45658/Dokidoki_Mini_Mini_Kakushi_Dungeon_Gekijou", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1736/111113.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1736/111113t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1736/111113l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1736/111113.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1736/111113t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1736/111113l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Dokidoki!

Therefore, she thought, if the God only gives me a scenario with no freedom, I want to share the \"death\" with you, not that \"someone.\" I want to give the half of destiny to her, even if I have to share the \"death\" with her.\n\n(Source: MAL News)", "background": "", "season": "fall", "year": 2017, "broadcast": {"day": "Tuesdays", "time": "01:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Tuesdays at 01:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 58, "type": "anime", "name": "Square Enix", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/58/Square_Enix"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 866, "type": "anime", "name": "Fanworks", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/866/Fanworks"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 38850, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/38850/Star\u2606Twinkle_Precure__Hoshi_no_Uta_ni_Omoi_wo_Komete", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1324/101596.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1324/101596t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1324/101596l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1324/101596.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1324/101596t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1324/101596l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "-TgdU8Fjb-E", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TgdU8Fjb-E", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/-TgdU8Fjb-E?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/-TgdU8Fjb-E/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/-TgdU8Fjb-E/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/-TgdU8Fjb-E/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/-TgdU8Fjb-E/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/-TgdU8Fjb-E/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Star\u2606Twinkle Precure: Hoshi no Uta ni Omoi wo Komete"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u6620\u753b\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u2606\u30c8\u30a5\u30a4\u30f3\u30af\u30eb\u30d7\u30ea\u30ad\u30e5\u30a2 \u661f\u306e\u3046\u305f\u306b\u60f3\u3044\u3092\u3053\u3081\u3066"}], "title": "Star\u2606Twinkle Precure: Hoshi no Uta ni Omoi wo Komete", "title_english": null, "title_japanese": "\u6620\u753b\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u2606\u30c8\u30a5\u30a4\u30f3\u30af\u30eb\u30d7\u30ea\u30ad\u30e5\u30a2 \u661f\u306e\u3046\u305f\u306b\u60f3\u3044\u3092\u3053\u3081\u3066", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "Movie", "source": "Original", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2019-10-19T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 19, "month": 10, "year": 2019}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Oct 19, 2019"}, "duration": "1 hr 11 min", "rating": "G - All Ages", "score": 7.79, "scored_by": 2119, "rank": 1094, "popularity": 9091, "members": 5140, "favorites": 21, "synopsis": "When a meteor shower causes a mysterious star-shaped alien to land in Lala Hagoromo and Hikaru Hoshina's home, the girls find themselves having to take care of the mischievous creature whom they name \"Yuma.\" Although their relationship gets off to a rocky start, Lala and Yuma eventually connect through their similar passions for music and exploration. \n\nHowever, when strange alien hunters targeting Yuma arrive on Earth, the girls learn that there is more to Yuma than what meets the eye.

The shards spread all through the world, each containing evil. If a shard went inside your eye, it would turn your heart to ice. A shard went into Kai's eye. After that, he grew cold to those he loved. \n\nOne night, the Snow Queen came in her carriage and took Kai back to her ice castle at the farthest north point of the world. Everyone in Kai and Gerda's village didn't know where he went and believed he died from drowning in the frozen-over lake. Gerda doesn't believe this, for she dreamed of seeing Kai enter the carriage. When a drunk man admits that he also saw this, Gerda starts realizing that maybe what she saw wasn't a dream. She packs her things and goes on a journey to save Kai and bring him back home. \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)", "background": "Yuki no Joou was created in celebration of 200 years since Hans Christian Andersen's birth.

Kaname, however, feigns to be a \"herbivore\"-type man, but is in reality an aggressive \"carnivore\"-type man, and he can change his demeanor in an instant.\n\n(Source: ANN)", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 719, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio Mausu", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/719/Studio_Mausu"}, {"mal_id": 1760, "type": "anime", "name": "Suiseisha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1760/Suiseisha"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 2405, "type": "anime", "name": "Staple Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2405/Staple_Entertainment"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 12, "type": "anime", "name": "Hentai", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/12/Hentai"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 43, "type": "anime", "name": "Josei", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/43/Josei"}]}, {"mal_id": 35480, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/35480/Karadasagashi", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/87141.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/87141t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/87141l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/87141.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/87141t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/87141l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "Jn4mdREDiYs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jn4mdREDiYs", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jn4mdREDiYs?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/Jn4mdREDiYs/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/Jn4mdREDiYs/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/Jn4mdREDiYs/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/Jn4mdREDiYs/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/Jn4mdREDiYs/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Karadasagashi"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Body Search"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Re/member"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30ab\u30e9\u30c0\u63a2\u3057"}], "title": "Karadasagashi", "title_english": null, "title_japanese": "\u30ab\u30e9\u30c0\u63a2\u3057", "title_synonyms": ["Body Search", "Re/member"], "type": "ONA", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 10, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2017-07-30T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2017-08-31T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 30, "month": 7, "year": 2017}, "to": {"day": 31, "month": 8, "year": 2017}}, "string": "Jul 30, 2017 to Aug 31, 2017"}, "duration": "3 min per ep", "rating": "R - 17+ (violence & profanity)", "score": 5.42, "scored_by": 268, "rank": 12707, "popularity": 9132, "members": 5084, "favorites": 6, "synopsis": "\"Hey, Asuka... search for my body.\" \n\nAt school in the middle of the night, Asuka and her friends search for the scattered body-parts.

His grades are failing, and his father \u2013 traditional and strict (but who must have also at some point gave in and allowed him to have a motorcycle) \u2013 is trying everything he can think of to get the kid to apply for college. His mother is so silent, she might as well not even exist. Really, his support system lies entirely in his twinkle-toed little sister, who's nosy but cheers him on in her own way.\n\nBobby really does little else but work on his bike. He cleans his bike. He tunes up his bike. He rides his bike. One would call him a motorcycle otaku. His most recent achievement seems to have been getting photos of himself on a road trip printed in a motorcyclist hobby magazine. This leads to an unexpected result: a girl his age, who picked up that issue on a whim, decides to write him a letter. A long, rambling letter, but dreamily romantic just the same. Bobby admits to his sister that he's never gotten a letter from a girl before. He writes back, \"I got your letter. I'm happy 'cause it was from a girl.\"\n\nBobby is not a well-rounded kid. He barely speaks \u2013 even to his own family \u2013 and the \"letters\" he writes back to the mystery girl usually consist of a single sentence or so. His obsession is all-consuming, to the point where he happily quits school to work at a biker bar. Of course, his father, at a loss, kicks him out of the house.
