But this is not an easy task when Lord Helmet of the Boskone Empire is willing to use everything in his power to stop him.\n\n(Source: ANN)", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 159, "type": "anime", "name": "Kodansha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 2278, "type": "anime", "name": "Harmony Gold", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2278/Harmony_Gold"}, {"mal_id": 2518, "type": "anime", "name": "Streamline Pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2518/Streamline_Pictures"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 11, "type": "anime", "name": "Madhouse", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/11/Madhouse"}, {"mal_id": 1179, "type": "anime", "name": "MK Pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1179/MK_Pictures"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 29, "type": "anime", "name": "Space", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/29/Space"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 1329, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/1329/Ohoshi-sama_no_Rail", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/85355.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/85355t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/85355l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/85355.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/85355t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/85355l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Ohoshi-sama no Rail"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "O-Hoshisama no Rail"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Ohoshi-sama no Rail"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u304a\u661f\u3055\u307e\u306e\u30ec\u30fc\u30eb"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Rail of the Star: A True Story of Children"}], "title": "Ohoshi-sama no Rail", "title_english": "Rail of the Star: A True Story of Children", "title_japanese": "\u304a\u661f\u3055\u307e\u306e\u30ec\u30fc\u30eb", "title_synonyms": ["O-Hoshisama no Rail", "Ohoshi-sama no Rail"], "type": "Movie", "source": "Novel", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "1993-07-10T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 10, "month": 7, "year": 1993}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Jul 10, 1993"}, "duration": "1 hr 15 min", "rating": "G - All Ages", "score": 6.96, "scored_by": 1215, "rank": 4669, "popularity": 9734, "members": 4198, "favorites": 5, "synopsis": "This is the autobiographic tale of Kobayashi Chitose, a young Japanese girl growing up in a Japanese-occupied North Korea. As World War II progresses, Chitose begins to realize that her family will not be able to escape the effects of the conflict. From the simple disappointment of not being able to get the type of backpack she wants for school, to her father's recruitment as a soldier, the war begins to impact her life in a very real manner. But the end of the war does not mean the end of hardship for her. The Koreans, fed up with years of Japanese rule and persecution, have joined forces with a Chinese-backed communist government and are systematically making life a living horror for the Japanese left in North Korea. Fearing reprisal since he was a Japanese veteran, Chitose's father risks everything to get his family out of the north and to the US-occupied area south of the 38th parallel.\n\n(Source: AniDB)", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 16, "type": "anime", "name": "TV Tokyo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 97, "type": "anime", "name": "ADV Films", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/97/ADV_Films"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 11, "type": "anime", "name": "Madhouse", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/11/Madhouse"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 13, "type": "anime", "name": "Historical", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 55003, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/55003/1LDK___JK_Ikinari_Doukyo_Micchaku_Hatsu_Ecchi", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1788/150015.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1788/150015t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1788/150015l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1788/150015.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1788/150015t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1788/150015l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "1LDK + JK Ikinari Doukyo?

Akko-chan is then given the gift of a magical mirror and taught an enchantment that will allow her to transform into anything she wishes.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)", "background": "", "season": "winter", "year": 1969, "broadcast": {"day": "Mondays", "time": "19:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Mondays at 19:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 18, "type": "anime", "name": "Toei Animation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/18/Toei_Animation"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 66, "type": "anime", "name": "Mahou Shoujo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/66/Mahou_Shoujo"}, {"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 25, "type": "anime", "name": "Shoujo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo"}]}, {"mal_id": 10823, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/10823/Ranma_\u00bd__1994_Music_Calendar", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/29891.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/29891t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/29891l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/29891.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/29891t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/29891l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Ranma \u00bd: 1994 Music Calendar"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Ranma 1/2: 1994 Music Calendar"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u3089\u3093\u307e1/2 1994\u5e74\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u30ab\u30ec\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc"}], "title": "Ranma \u00bd: 1994 Music Calendar", "title_english": null, "title_japanese": "\u3089\u3093\u307e1/2 1994\u5e74\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u30ab\u30ec\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc", "title_synonyms": ["Ranma 1/2: 1994 Music Calendar"], "type": "OVA", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "1993-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 1, "month": 1, "year": 1993}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "1993"}, "duration": "20 min", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 6.58, "scored_by": 1289, "rank": 6745, "popularity": 9753, "members": 4169, "favorites": 3, "synopsis": "Series clips shown along with the music that freeze-frames when a new move is shown.

One recurring gag involves the kid with a turban repeatedly stabbing Souther in the leg every time he climbs the pyramid's staircase, and another involves Rei suddenly transforming into Souther in his iconic moments. \n\n(Source: Hokuto no Ken Wikia)", "background": "", "season": "fall", "year": 2015, "broadcast": {"day": "Wednesdays", "time": "01:35", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Wednesdays at 01:35 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 1534, "type": "anime", "name": "North Stars Pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1534/North_Stars_Pictures"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 30, "type": "anime", "name": "Ajia-do", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/30/Ajia-do"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 20, "type": "anime", "name": "Parody", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/20/Parody"}, {"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 42, "type": "anime", "name": "Seinen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]}, {"mal_id": 59711, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/59711/Shibou_Yuugi_de_Meshi_wo_Kuu", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1834/151169.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1834/151169t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1834/151169l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1834/151169.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1834/151169t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1834/151169l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "9qGxpihfOgg", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qGxpihfOgg", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/9qGxpihfOgg?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/9qGxpihfOgg/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/9qGxpihfOgg/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/9qGxpihfOgg/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/9qGxpihfOgg/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/9qGxpihfOgg/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Shibou Yuugi de Meshi wo Kuu."}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u6b7b\u4ea1\u904a\u622f\u3067\u98ef\u3092\u98df\u3046\u3002"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Playing Death Games to Put Food on the Table"}], "title": "Shibou Yuugi de Meshi wo Kuu.", "title_english": "Playing Death Games to Put Food on the Table", "title_japanese": "\u6b7b\u4ea1\u904a\u622f\u3067\u98ef\u3092\u98df\u3046\u3002", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "TV", "source": "Light novel", "episodes": null, "status": "Not yet aired", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2026-01-01T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 1, "month": 1, "year": 2026}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Jan 2026 to ?"}, "duration": "Unknown", "rating": null, "score": null, "scored_by": null, "rank": null, "popularity": 9863, "members": 4036, "favorites": 10, "synopsis": "Yuki wakes up to find herself in an unfamiliar manor, wearing a maid uniform and lying on a luxurious bed.

When Daiba comes to, he finds himself in a spaceship infirmary under observation. Stealing a fighter that he didn't know how to pilot (until he tried it), he breaks out, flying like a total pro.\n\nHe was able to remember how to pilot from his DNA memory... and to find out more, his doctor friend takes him to his secret underground lab, in which he acts as a professor to find out ways to stop the traitor regime. When the forces invade to take him back, a girl named Rei Yuuki mysteriously shoots down their entire carrier with only a fighter jet! Apparently, both have mysterious powers that the enemies want, which may or may not be connected to their being the only two known survivors of the meteor impact.\n\nWhile looking for a third survivor (which turned out to be a cat), the two are taken by force to Queen Photon (ruler of the traitor regime), who claims that she is out to SAVE the Earth from those who sent the Meteor. The two don't know whether to believe her or Mello until the (telepathic) cat breaks them out of the Queen's sealed chamber, and Mello comes to straighten things out. That's when the two (er, three) of them make a choice...
