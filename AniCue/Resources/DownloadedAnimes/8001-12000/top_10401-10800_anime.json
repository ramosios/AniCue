At first Yamato think she\u2019s going crazy when he gets messages from a spectral young woman, but she eventually convinces him to take the plunge\u2026 through a mystical portal to ancient Mu.\n\nBefore the Tokyo teen can get acclimated, Dragonia attacks again, but this time, the dinosaurs and soldiers are repulsed by the giant God Mazinger, now merged with Yamato. Though Mu has achieved it's first victory, they have along way to go, as does Yamato, who will need to over come his own deep character flaws and become a true warrior to save the kingdom and get back home. \n\n(Source: Discotek)", "background": "God Mazinger is a manga, anime, and novel series by Go Nagai in 1984.

While God Mazinger has no connection to the other Mazinger series, it is indeed part of the Mazinger franchise as besides the title and the same author as the other series it is featured in the Mazinger Bible along with other manga such Mazinger (USA) and MazinSaga. The anime version was originally going to feature 24 episodes and while material was drawn up the final epilogue episode was never shown. Part of the reason is because the air date was removed for the 1984 Olympics, and TMS for some reason decided to cut the epilogue from the show entirely.

Given that Lana is the telepathic granddaughter of renowned scientist Dr. Briac Lao, Industria's authorities desire her cooperation, as they believe her abilities will help them locate the doctor and acquire his expertise to access a powerful energy source.\n\nDespite the best efforts of Conan and his grandfather, they fail to prevent Lana's recapture when Industrian soldiers arrive. Vowing to rescue her, Conan bravely embarks on a breathtaking adventure, yet the journey comes with higher stakes than he realizes.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Mirai Shounen Conan (Movie) is a summarized version of the television series, but made without the involvement of the series' director Hayao Miyazaki. Due to significant changes made to adapt the story into a two-hour movie and the use of a different soundtrack, the result was not well-received by fans. To promote the film, a \"Conan Festival\" was held at Nippon Budokan on July 20, 1979. Nippon Broadcasting System ran a four-hour live broadcast during its All Night Nippon program on August 31, 1979, featuring a live radio drama of the film with a newly written script.

Upon the throning of the young king Yaiba, treacherous rebels were executed to restore the peace the country once had. However, tainted by this radical act of governance, Atlantia continues to be enveloped under the shadow of oppressive rule.\n\nTsurugi Tatewaki is a spunky teenager who grew up in the rural countryside with little memory of his birth parents. One day in his home, he stumbles upon a mysterious sword that transforms into a Battle Spirits card. When armed forces from Atlantia confront Tsurugi with their sights set on procuring his card, the secrets behind Tsurugi's past seemingly begin to unravel.\n\nAccompanied by a droid named Bringer, Tsurugi makes his way to the capital of Atlantia and encounters supposed warriors who wield similar swords. As his world is slowly turned upside down by the gradual appearance of greater mysteries, Tsurugi may have to question everything he knows, including his very own judgment on what separates good from evil.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "fall", "year": 2012, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": "Unknown"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 1366, "type": "anime", "name": "Nagoya Broadcasting Network", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1366/Nagoya_Broadcasting_Network"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 14, "type": "anime", "name": "Sunrise", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/14/Sunrise"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 11, "type": "anime", "name": "Strategy Game", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/11/Strategy_Game"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 52573, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/52573/Uta_no\u2606Prince-sama\u266a_Maji_Love_ST\u2606RISH_Tours__Tabi_no_Hajimari", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1479/126366.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1479/126366t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1479/126366l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1479/126366.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1479/126366t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1479/126366l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "LQL_I7dmDJU", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQL_I7dmDJU", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/LQL_I7dmDJU?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/LQL_I7dmDJU/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/LQL_I7dmDJU/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/LQL_I7dmDJU/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/LQL_I7dmDJU/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/LQL_I7dmDJU/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Uta no\u2606Prince-sama\u266a Maji Love ST\u2606RISH Tours: Tabi no Hajimari"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Utapri Special TV"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Uta no Prince-sama Maji Love Starish: Tabi no Hajimari"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Uta no Prince-sama Maji Love ST\u2606RISH Tours: The Journey Begin"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u3046\u305f\u306e\u2606\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30b9\u3055\u307e\u3063\u266a \u30de\u30b8LOVE\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30ea\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30c4\u30a2\u30fc\u30ba \uff5e\u65c5\u306e\u59cb\u307e\u308a\uff5e"}], "title": "Uta no\u2606Prince-sama\u266a Maji Love ST\u2606RISH Tours: Tabi no Hajimari", "title_english": null, "title_japanese": "\u3046\u305f\u306e\u2606\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30b9\u3055\u307e\u3063\u266a \u30de\u30b8LOVE\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30ea\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30c4\u30a2\u30fc\u30ba \uff5e\u65c5\u306e\u59cb\u307e\u308a\uff5e", "title_synonyms": ["Utapri Special TV", "Uta no Prince-sama Maji Love Starish: Tabi no Hajimari", "Uta no Prince-sama Maji Love ST\u2606RISH Tours: The Journey Begin"], "type": "TV Special", "source": "Visual novel", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2022-07-31T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 31, "month": 7, "year": 2022}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Jul 31, 2022"}, "duration": "47 min", "rating": "PG-13 -

After commencing its mission of exploration, the starship Rugger-Guard is attacked by a ship of the Galbeston Empire. Dairugger, the super robot, is deployed in order to defend the Earth. It is somewhat by fate that they must help the people of Galbeston find a new planet before it explodes, and liberate it from its despotic Emperor. In the Japanese version, it does not have anything to do with King of the Beasts GoLion, as opposed to the U.S. version, Voltron: Defender of the Universe.\n\nThere are three assault team units: Land, Air, and Sea.

Ever since she could remember, Akane Ousaki has been mesmerized by her father Tooru's rakugo performances. Peeking in behind a sliding door, she would spend hours watching and mimicking his work.\n\nFor Tooru, the only thing separating him from that coveted rank is a promotion test in front of an audience and a senior rakugo master, Issho Arakawa. Despite his passionate performance, Tooru finds himself expelled from the rakugo school following the exam. This makes him give up on rakugo entirely and settle for a regular job, breaking his daughter's heart.\n\nFilled with grief and anger, Akane now seeks vengeance on the man who refuses to see the genius behind her father's rakugo style. She begs Tooru's former rakugo master, Shiguma Arakawa, to take her under his wing. But Shiguma feels unworthy of taking on another pupil after what happened to her father six years prior. In order to see if she has what it takes to enter the rakugo world, Shiguma urges Akane to test her resolve by performing in front of an audience.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": "Unknown"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 17, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 218, "type": "anime", "name": "Zexcs", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/218/Zexcs"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 70, "type": "anime", "name": "Performing Arts", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/70/Performing_Arts"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]}, {"mal_id": 3481, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/3481/Grendizer__Getter_Robo_G_-_Great_Mazinger_Kessen_Daikaijuu", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1125/99760.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1125/99760t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1125/99760l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1125/99760.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1125/99760t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1125/99760l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "02heAr-Jics", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02heAr-Jics", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/02heAr-Jics?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/02heAr-Jics/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/02heAr-Jics/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/02heAr-Jics/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/02heAr-Jics/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/02heAr-Jics/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Grendizer: Getter Robo G - Great Mazinger Kessen!

They crash into a black hole which is connected to another universe. The people on the ship are cast adrift in an emergency capsule to a planet called Ismo. The story begins 12 years after they have reached Ismo.\n\nIsmo is a star of the Onam System, which corresponds to the Solar System in our universe. It is the only planet left in the Onam System. The Death Star called Yomi is a comet which regularly approaches the Onam System.\n\nThere were once 8 planets in the Onam System. Many years ago, in the time of the gods, there was a war against the evil monster Yamatano Orochi (an 8-headed snake-like creature). The gods won the battle. Yamatano Orochi was locked into 8 stones, one of which is buried deep in the center of each planet. Nobody was supposed to have access to the core of the planets. However Tsukuyomi, an evil god who rules Yomi, succeeded in reaching the stones one after another, destroying 7 of the planets using his powerful robots, the Sky Warriors. However, when he tried to acquire the last stone from the planet Ismo, the most powerful Sky Warrior, Susanoo, got out of control and was blown away.\n\nA million years later, the Death Star Yomi is approaching the Onam System once again. Tsukuyomi, the master of Yomi, plans to take this opportunity to realize his dream of ruling the entire universe. He is desperate for the last stone containing Yamatano Orochi. If Tsukuyomi can get hold of this stone, Yamatano Orochi will return to life and its power will become his. Tsukuyomi needs Sky Warrior Susanoo to capture the stone, and sends 8 Sky Soldiers to get Susanoo back. But it is too late. Susanoo no longer belongs to Tsukuyomi. It belongs to Takeru, a 13-year-old boy from Earth, who happened to discover the buried robot Susanoo and woke it from its million-year-long sleep. Takeru becomes involved in the battle against the Sky Soldiers and their evil master, Tsukuyomi. Susanoo stands up to protect his friends and their planet.\n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 1994, "broadcast": {"day": "Saturdays", "time": "17:30", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Saturdays at 17:30 (JST)"}, "producers": [], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Nippon Animation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/22/Nippon_Animation"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 18, "type": "anime", "name": "Mecha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}, {"mal_id": 29, "type": "anime", "name": "Space", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/29/Space"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 37886, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/37886/Wo_Shi_Jiang_Xiaobai_2018", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1170/116403.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1170/116403t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1170/116403l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1170/116403.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1170/116403t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1170/116403l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "3wCpx7coNIk", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wCpx7coNIk", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/3wCpx7coNIk?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/3wCpx7coNIk/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/3wCpx7coNIk/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/3wCpx7coNIk/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/3wCpx7coNIk/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/3wCpx7coNIk/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Wo Shi Jiang Xiaobai (2018)"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Wo Shi Jiang Xiaobai: Shijie Shang de Ling Yige Wo"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u6211\u662f\u6c5f\u5c0f\u767d \u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u7684\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u6211"}, {"type": "English", "title": "I'm Joybo OVA"}], "title": "Wo Shi Jiang Xiaobai (2018)", "title_english": "I'm Joybo OVA", "title_japanese": "\u6211\u662f\u6c5f\u5c0f\u767d \u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u7684\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u6211", "title_synonyms": ["Wo Shi Jiang Xiaobai: Shijie Shang de Ling Yige Wo"], "type": "ONA", "source": "Original", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2018-05-25T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 25, "month": 5, "year": 2018}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "May 25, 2018"}, "duration": "37 min", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 7.03, "scored_by": 844, "rank": 4377, "popularity": 10775, "members": 3057, "favorites": 5, "synopsis": "Jiang Xiaobai has regained his memories, and Tong Li cannot bring herself to face him.

Running out of the store, she discovers a huge TV screen which reflects a \"real-life\" image of herself. Playing around with it, she is soon joined by a Cure Doll of Rhythm. The two spot Hummy, waiting several floors down on the dance floor, who waved at them and sends up two rainbow keyboards to the Cure Dolls. Nodding to each other, the two slide down the keyboard onto the dance floor, and the concert began. The concert ends with a shot of the huge TV screen shown during the introduction. The 3 Suite\u266a Cures are seen smiling and waving at the audience, and as the shot zoomed out, the 3 Cure Dolls are shown at the bottom of the screen.\n\n(Source: Pretty Cure Wiki)", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 18, "type": "anime", "name": "Toei Animation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/18/Toei_Animation"}], "genres": [], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 66, "type": "anime", "name": "Mahou Shoujo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/66/Mahou_Shoujo"}, {"mal_id": 19, "type": "anime", "name": "Music", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/19/Music"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 34615, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/34615/Usakame_Special", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/83507.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/83507t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/83507l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/83507.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/83507t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/83507l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Usakame Special"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u3046\u3055\u304b\u3081"}], "title": "Usakame Special", "title_english": null, "title_japanese": "\u3046\u3055\u304b\u3081", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "Special", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2016-08-26T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 26, "month": 8, "year": 2016}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Aug 26, 2016"}, "duration": "3 min", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 5.6, "scored_by": 1337, "rank": 12115, "popularity": 10782, "members": 3052, "favorites": 0, "synopsis": "Unaired episode included with the Blu-ray.", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 315, "type": "anime", "name": "DAX Production", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/315/DAX_Production"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 1237, "type": "anime", "name": "Millepensee", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1237/Millepensee"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 30, "type": "anime", "name": "Sports", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/30/Sports"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]}, {"mal_id": 36223, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/36223/New_My_Tear_CL_Series", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/87497.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/87497t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/87497l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/87497.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/87497t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/87497l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "New My Tear CL Series"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Uchiage Hanabi"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Shita kara Miru ka?

Assuming that the warrior is dead, Drago and Empress Zara are free to conquer the Earth using their army of biomechanical beasts.

In a burst of anger, Ken's Liger birthmark appears, and he rises his palm into the air, shouting the henshin command, \"LIGER!!!\", which then covers him in demonic long-haired biomechanical armor.
