The first deals with a group of young women who, after being out of school for a few years, are beginning to think about settling down. However, there is one member of the group who has no prospects, and Shizuka's friends are worried that her shyness will keep Mr. Right from noticing her beauty and character. \n\nThey persuade her to join a dating service called The Wedding Club, but when her first match seems to be quite a dud, Shizuka wonders if a trip down the isle just isn't in her future. The second episode is about five sisters, only one of whom isn't married. What's more, the cool Kiyomi seems to have no interest whatsoever in finding a husband. Her sisters have other ideas, though, and when a co-worker asks her out on a date, the women convince the suitor to propose marriage that very night.This is easier said than done, however, as Kiyomi's attitude can be quite intimidating. \n\nThe young man may not end up following through with the plan, but even if he does there is no guarantee that the headstrong lady in question will say yes. \n\n(Source: All Movie Guide)", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 123, "type": "anime", "name": "Victor Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/123/Victor_Entertainment"}, {"mal_id": 3087, "type": "anime", "name": "Shogakukan Productions", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/3087/Shogakukan_Productions"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 250, "type": "anime", "name": "Media Blasters", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/250/Media_Blasters"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 2833, "type": "anime", "name": "Sofix", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2833/Sofix"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 1907, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/1907/Harukanaru_Toki_no_Naka_de__Hachiyou_Shou_OVA", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/72169.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/72169t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/72169l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/72169.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/72169t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/7/72169l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Harukanaru Toki no Naka de: Hachiyou Shou OVA"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Destination of the Heart"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Where the Heart Belongs"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "HaruToki Special"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Haruka naru Toki no Naka de: Omoi no Arika (Chi)"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Haruka naru Toki no Naka de: Kokoro no Yukue (Ten)"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Harukanaru Toki no Naka de: Kokoro no Yukue"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u9059\u304b\u306a\u308b\u6642\u7a7a\u306e\u4e2d\u3067\u301c\u516b\u8449\u6284\u301c"}], "title": "Harukanaru Toki no Naka de: Hachiyou Shou OVA", "title_english": null, "title_japanese": "\u9059\u304b\u306a\u308b\u6642\u7a7a\u306e\u4e2d\u3067\u301c\u516b\u8449\u6284\u301c", "title_synonyms": ["Destination of the Heart", "Where the Heart Belongs", "HaruToki Special", "Haruka naru Toki no Naka de: Omoi no Arika (Chi)", "Haruka naru Toki no Naka de: Kokoro no Yukue (Ten)", "Harukanaru Toki no Naka de: Kokoro no Yukue"], "type": "OVA", "source": "Visual novel", "episodes": 2, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2005-12-23T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2006-01-27T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 23, "month": 12, "year": 2005}, "to": {"day": 27, "month": 1, "year": 2006}}, "string": "Dec 23, 2005 to Jan 27, 2006"}, "duration": "21 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 6.45, "scored_by": 689, "rank": 7591, "popularity": 11615, "members": 2392, "favorites": 3, "synopsis": "Two side stories to the main series\n Kokoro no Yukue (Ten) ~ Destination of the Heart\nStory featuring the four Hachiyou of Heaven: Yorihisa and Takamichi, Eisen and Inori.\nMinor incidents lead to the Hachiyou suspecting each other of committing a small 'crime'.

Because of the violent actions of her brother Susanoo, the sun goddess Amaterasu retreats and shuts herself in the Ama no Iwato (heavenly cave). The gods gather around the cave and the goddess Ame no Uzume dances in front of it.

The audience is expected to be enamored with this vehicle. At one scene when it looks like the tank is sure to get away, the background music turns into cocktail-lounge jazz and sparkly lights swirl around the tank. The tank carries six ATGM launchers (which Ken is somehow able to dislodge with minimal trouble, along with a piece of the turret, towards the end of the movie), three to each side of the turret, and a laser-based machine-gun-esque installment, in addition to its rifled main gun. The tank's treads are dual-mounted (the tread is split in half, making four sets of treads for the tank).\n\nThe employment of the laser, however, seems counter-productive to a machine-gun's mission, as it can only fire once every few seconds. If it can fire at higher rates, it does not do so, and tries to acquire a lock on its pursuer (Blader, in this case). This suggests a low ammunition capacity, unlike thousand-round-and-up machine-guns routinely mounted on modern tanks. It does not appear to have any effect on the road, either, which does not say much about its power.\n\nAnother tank involved is the MBT-90D, which are dispatched by the Army (or Air Force\u2014the movie never makes it clear if it is a joint effort, although the general who arrives midway into the movie is shown riding in something resembling an ADATS) to take out the tank. Despite having at least a platoon of these, the MBT-99 still evades capture. The M-90Ds are armed with a three-barreled autocannon, the calibre of which may be around fifteen to twenty millimeters. The MBT-90D is equipped with three ATGM missile launchers, on the left side of the turret, and its main cannon is mounted on the front, instead of on a turret.\n\nAfter the MBT-99's hijackers (who appear inside the tank after getting away from a recently-committed bank robbery), hired by a shadowy group, backed by a foreign nation seeking an edge in their military (the M-99 is presumably on its way to be tested at a separate base), are forced out by Ken and his team, Eleanor enters to study the tank, and it starts up on its own, having been programmed by the hijackers to head for a pier and drive off its end so as to rendezvous with an enemy submarine. The rest of the movie is made up of the chase through the city, resulting in the destruction of another bank (owned by the same corporation that built the first bank in the movie), and various collateral damage.", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 199, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio Nue", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/199/Studio_Nue"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 72, "type": "anime", "name": "Artmic", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/72/Artmic"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 39, "type": "anime", "name": "Detective", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/39/Detective"}, {"mal_id": 18, "type": "anime", "name": "Mecha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 37013, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/37013/Sex__Prologue", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1499/94818.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1499/94818t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1499/94818l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1499/94818.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1499/94818t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1499/94818l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Sex: Prologue"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "SEX\uff5ePrologue\uff5e"}], "title": "Sex: Prologue", "title_english": null, "title_japanese": "SEX\uff5ePrologue\uff5e", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "OVA", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2018-05-07T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 7, "month": 5, "year": 2018}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "May 7, 2018"}, "duration": "1 min", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 5.9, "scored_by": 279, "rank": 10705, "popularity": 11824, "members": 2252, "favorites": 3, "synopsis": "The anime depicts an original story before Kaho arrives, when Yuki and Natsu have just met in Okinawa.\n\n(Source: ANN)", "background": "The promotional video is a home video exclusive.

A boy who is the descendant of the leader of the theives who met a grisly fate in the 1001 Nights bands together with 38 cats and a mouse to get back his rightful treasure from Ali Baba XXXIII, the descendent of Ali Baba who now rules the kingdom with an iron fist. This is a reversal of the good guy/bad guy roles in the original story! (perhaps not surprising for being a film in which Hayao Miyazaki was involved) This film is one of the most rollicking and action-packed films made by Toei, and is in an outrageously cartoonish style breaking with the Toei mold. It has a spectacular lineup of animators including Yasuji Mori, Akira Daikubara, Hayao Miyazaki, Yoichi Kotabe and Reiko Okuyama.

The governing rule of the series was that the creative staff change from episode to episode. While later other anime series like Nippon Animation's Famous Works of Japanese Literature would attempt the same, none would be as long-lived or successful. \n\nThe rotation idea was that of director Sugii Gisaburo, a visual visionary unequaled in Japanese film history who has revolutionized anime several times in his career, be it in the 1967 TV series Goku's Big Adventure, in which he sought to shake anime free from the dominance of story development by yanking it back to a more cartoonish form, or The Belladonna of Sadness, where he broke the Disney full-animation mold, creating a full-length animated film in a completely new style that was a hybrid of still drawings and animation. The reason for rotating the staff each episode was so that each episode would have a completely different look and feel from its predecessor, and in this it was eminently successful. This is a series that is genuinely rewarding to watch, and is visually one of the richest in anime history. \n\nWhile this system also meant that quality varied, there were also occasionally superb episodes, as on the staff were many veterans like Group Tac founder SUGII Gisaburo himself, SHIBAYAMA Tsutomu, FURUZAWA Hideo, RIN Taro, and HIKONE Norio. Old episodes started being repeated more and more frequently as the years went on, and production of new episodes finally ceased completely in late 1995, but the series is still widely broadcast. \n\n(Source: Pelleas)", "background": "", "season": "winter", "year": 1976, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": "Unknown"}, "producers": [], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 86, "type": "anime", "name": "Group TAC", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/86/Group_TAC"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 13, "type": "anime", "name": "Historical", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 37537, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/37537/Sobakasu", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1828/101980.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1828/101980t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1828/101980l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1828/101980.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1828/101980t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1828/101980l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Sobakasu"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Lon Kaba\uff0dJ-POP ZOO\uff0d"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Freckles"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u305d\u3070\u304b\u3059"}], "title": "Sobakasu", "title_english": null, "title_japanese": "\u305d\u3070\u304b\u3059", "title_synonyms": ["Lon Kaba\uff0dJ-POP ZOO\uff0d", "Freckles"], "type": "Music", "source": "Music", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2015-08-25T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 25, "month": 8, "year": 2015}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Aug 25, 2015"}, "duration": "4 min", "rating": "G - All Ages", "score": 5.79, "scored_by": 994, "rank": null, "popularity": 11871, "members": 2230, "favorites": 2, "synopsis": "Music video for Lon's cover of Sobakasu by the band Judy and Mary.

She continued to escape, but Yuri Aoshima, a member of a shady organization, tried to contact her. Orine agreed to Yuri's demand, which was going to an experimental space station. Yuri will help her to escape, instead.\n\nSomehow, only Orine can enter an unmanned space station. Surprisingly, the person who was waiting for Orine was her mother, Satomi.

The only other name among the staff that rings a bell, though, is Yukihide Takekawa, who was responsible for the music in the magnificent and unknown Unico pilot film. \n\nThe story takes some illogical and confusing jumps at the point where Aladdin begins to court the princess, and the extravagant animation that had characterised Toei films of the 60s, when Toei had the best animators around, had become a thing of the past long before this point; but this is still an above-average film, in large part because of the screenplay that stays so faithful to the original.

This was the first movie to feature seiyuu Kouji Yada, who appears in all following movies (except the final two), and also the first to feature series creators Yudetamago in a cameo. Octopus Dragon, Harigoras, and Ukon are all kaijuu from the infamous \"Roots Island\" two-part story from the original manga that does not appear in recent reprints. Tigerian is also a kaijuu from the original manga, although these characters bear little resemblance to their manga counterparts. The movie's monster Gigasaurus does resemble the manga's Octopus Dragon.
