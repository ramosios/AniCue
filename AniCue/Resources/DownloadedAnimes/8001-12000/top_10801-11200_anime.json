The Eto Rangers themselves are anthropomorphic animals, each representing one of the 12 Chinese zodiac animals (and The Twelve Branches in Buddhism). In Japan they are known as the Eto animals. The Novel Worlds are stories created by the human imagination, such as old folk tales as well as newer books. These living worlds play out repeatedly, and are necessary for the good of humanity. Princess Aura rules Mugen, which is an island continent hanging over an ocean from the skybound Novel Pole. The Great God Goal gives her power, but she may never leave the small palace island area. Their nemesis is the forgotten Spirit of Cats, Nyanma (real name, Chocolat), who was excluded from the choice of 12 protectors by being disqualified from the race (in actual legend there are many versions of this story). She seeks her revenge by distorting Novel Worlds with Jarei Monsters.\n\nWhen a Jarei Monster goes to a Novel World they alter the story, turning it into a different version, sometimes a parody of itself. Bakumaru, the Spirit of Mice, must use the Genmakyou mirror to reveal (\"Jarei Shouran!\") the evil spirit once enough clues lead to its identity. Often the Eto Rangers must play out some of the story to find out who or what it is, sometimes even taking on the role of one of the characters in the tale. After defeating the creature, Kirinda is called when Bakumaru holds up his hand with one of Aura's 12 gems on it and calls out \"Daikourin Kirinda!\" Kirinda descends from a dimensional slit and purifies the evil spirit with a beam weapon, calling out \"Jouka!\" (Purification).\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 1995, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": "Unknown"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 429, "type": "anime", "name": "Office AO", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/429/Office_AO"}, {"mal_id": 1157, "type": "anime", "name": "Big Bang", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1157/Big_Bang"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 44, "type": "anime", "name": "Shaft", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/44/Shaft"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 51, "type": "anime", "name": "Anthropomorphic", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/51/Anthropomorphic"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 2801, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/2801/Candy_Candy__Haru_no_Yobigoe", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1967/94757.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1967/94757t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1967/94757l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1967/94757.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1967/94757t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1967/94757l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Candy Candy: Haru no Yobigoe"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u30fb\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3 \u6625\u306e\u547c\u3073\u58f0"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Candy Candy: The Call of Spring"}], "title": "Candy Candy: Haru no Yobigoe", "title_english": "Candy Candy: The Call of Spring", "title_japanese": "\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u30fb\u30ad\u30e3\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3 \u6625\u306e\u547c\u3073\u58f0", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "Movie", "source": "Unknown", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "1978-03-18T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 18, "month": 3, "year": 1978}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Mar 18, 1978"}, "duration": "25 min", "rating": "G - All Ages", "score": 6.58, "scored_by": 1190, "rank": 6755, "popularity": 10801, "members": 3029, "favorites": 4, "synopsis": "Candy returns to Pony's Home and she meets a girl who has lost her parents and doesn't associate with the other kids.

There's a little disclaimer at the front that says \"This is non-fiction, so I apologize for the lack of drama,\" and indeed, it mostly is just about them riding trains from place to place, waiting on platforms, etc. \n\nThe \"travel writer\" turns out to be a super train-otaku who has vast knowledge of the train network, but also micro-manages all their trips, planning every detail down to the second. He cares mostly about following the schedule and successfully achieving his planned goals (e.g. visiting all stations on a line in a completely bizarre order to accomodate infrequent trains). The mangaka doesn't really care about trains; she's cynical, sarcastic, and rather lazy (she mainly just looks forward to the next eki-ben); he's completely gung-ho as long as he's following the schedule, and the inevitable conflicts are pretty entertaining. \n\nThroughout, though, it feels real \u2014if you've travelled by train in Japan it will all seem very familiar, not just the scenery, but also the atmosphere and feel\u2014 and the artist does a great job of pacing and applying little tweaks to keep it consistently entertaining. In an additional bit of recursiveness, some of the characters who show up in the manga (who of course are real people, who really did show up) do so because they (really) read previous episodes of the manga! \n\nIn addition of course, you can learn about various out of the way and interesting Japanese train lines and stations; some of them really do look cool. There's always this vague sense of surreality about it however, the trips are all planned by the train-guy (goal: visit all 9,843 stations in Japan) who seems to consider everything as part of a checklist rather than an experience to be enjoyed. You learn a bit about train-otaku culture too; there's really only the one guy in the story, but train-otaku culture is a sort of constant peripheral presence. \n\n(Source: AniDB)", "background": "", "season": "summer", "year": 2007, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": "Unknown"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 141, "type": "anime", "name": "Toei Video", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/141/Toei_Video"}, {"mal_id": 577, "type": "anime", "name": "Tohokushinsha Film Corporation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/577/Tohokushinsha_Film_Corporation"}, {"mal_id": 1430, "type": "anime", "name": "Shogakukan", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1430/Shogakukan"}, {"mal_id": 3087, "type": "anime", "name": "Shogakukan Productions", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/3087/Shogakukan_Productions"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 86, "type": "anime", "name": "Group TAC", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/86/Group_TAC"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 36, "type": "anime", "name": "Slice of Life", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 42, "type": "anime", "name": "Seinen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]}, {"mal_id": 44071, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/44071/Yuan_Long_2nd_Season", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1138/110307.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1138/110307t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1138/110307l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1138/110307.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1138/110307t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1138/110307l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "k9Kmz-yHPUw", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9Kmz-yHPUw", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/k9Kmz-yHPUw?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/k9Kmz-yHPUw/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/k9Kmz-yHPUw/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/k9Kmz-yHPUw/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/k9Kmz-yHPUw/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/k9Kmz-yHPUw/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Yuan Long 2nd Season"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u5143\u9f99 \u7b2c\u4e8c\u5b63"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Carp Reborn 2nd Season"}], "title": "Yuan Long 2nd Season", "title_english": "Carp Reborn 2nd Season", "title_japanese": "\u5143\u9f99 \u7b2c\u4e8c\u5b63", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "ONA", "source": "Novel", "episodes": 16, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2021-07-03T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2021-10-02T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 3, "month": 7, "year": 2021}, "to": {"day": 2, "month": 10, "year": 2021}}, "string": "Jul 3, 2021 to Oct 2, 2021"}, "duration": "19 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 -

The Phoenix chooses a story entitled \"Old Woman\" (\"Oba-chan\") from numerous episodes of \"Black Jack\" to discuss the theme of how much love can grow in this short lifetime. In the story, there is a seemingly greedy old woman who is always asking her daughter-in-law for money, and her son and his wife become fed up with the old woman's behaviour. Naturally, there are constant quarrels in the family, and their quiet ordinary life seems to have been lost. \n\nAfter accidentally coming to know the family, Black Jack learns that the old woman had her young son, who was dying at the time, treated and saved by a noted doctor who claimed a great amount of money. She has, in fact, been paying for the treatment over some tens of years. Because of her great love for her son, the old woman devoted her entire life to paying for the treatment. \n\nNot aware of his mother's act, the son feels helplessly hammered and squeezed by his mother and his wife. But when he finally comes to know the truth, he is deeply impressed with the love of his mother, who valued her son's life more than her own. Black Jack asks him if he could love her just as much as she loved him. Explaining that only love valued more highly than life can live forever, the Phoenix then tells a story about the move of the capital to Heian, which was a great national project and an attempt to infuse a city with eternal life.\n\n(Source: Official site)", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 458, "type": "anime", "name": "Beijing Sharaku Art", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/458/Beijing_Sharaku_Art"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [], "genres": [], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 67, "type": "anime", "name": "Medical", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/67/Medical"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}]}, {"mal_id": 40909, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/40909/Wan_Jie_Xian_Zong_3rd_Season", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1059/105727.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1059/105727t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1059/105727l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1059/105727.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1059/105727t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1059/105727l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Wan Jie Xian Zong 3rd Season"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Wan Jie Xian Zong Di San Ji"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Wanjie Xianzong 3rd Season"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u4e07\u754c\u4ed9\u8e2a \u7b2c3\u5b63"}, {"type": "English", "title": "The Wonderland of Ten Thousand 3rd Season"}], "title": "Wan Jie Xian Zong 3rd Season", "title_english": "The Wonderland of Ten Thousand 3rd Season", "title_japanese": "\u4e07\u754c\u4ed9\u8e2a \u7b2c3\u5b63", "title_synonyms": ["Wan Jie Xian Zong Di San Ji", "Wanjie Xianzong 3rd Season"], "type": "ONA", "source": "Web manga", "episodes": 48, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2019-10-17T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2020-04-09T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 17, "month": 10, "year": 2019}, "to": {"day": 9, "month": 4, "year": 2020}}, "string": "Oct 17, 2019 to Apr 9, 2020"}, "duration": "7 min per ep", "rating": "PG-13 -

Some of these character faults include selfishness, rudeness, insensitivity, indolence, obstinacy, over- trusting, self-pity, stupidity, disobedience, compulsive lying, arrogance, greed, cowardice, recklessness, cruelty, foolishness and an inability to learn from mistakes.\n\nThroughout the entire series Pinocchio (Mokku), partly due to his own delinquency and repetitive disobedience, must undergo other costly ordeals of hardship and pain in which he is continuously tormented, persecuted, bullied, humiliated, tricked, ridiculed, ostracised, beaten, downtrodden and subjected to degrading and inhumane treatment. Its plain depiction of the austere reality of what it would be like to be literally subhuman growing up in a world of danger and hardship, makes this another good example of traditional Japanese stories, which teach moral observance through tough endurance.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)", "background": "", "season": "winter", "year": 1972, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": "Unknown"}, "producers": [], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 841, "type": "anime", "name": "Saban Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/841/Saban_Entertainment"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 103, "type": "anime", "name": "Tatsunoko Production", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/103/Tatsunoko_Production"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 3811, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/3811/Hoshi_no_Oujisama_Petit_Prince", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/36539.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/36539t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/36539l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/36539.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/36539t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/2/36539l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Hoshi no Oujisama Petit Prince"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Hoshi no Ojisama Petit Prince"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "The Little Prince"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Le Petit Prince"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "The Prince of the Stars: Le Petit Prince"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u661f\u306e\u738b\u5b50\u3055\u307e\u3000\u30d7\u30c1\u30fb\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9"}, {"type": "English", "title": "The Adventures of the Little Prince"}, {"type": "German", "title": "Die gro\u00dfen Abenteuer vom kleinen Prinzen"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "Las Aventuras de El Principito"}], "title": "Hoshi no Oujisama Petit Prince", "title_english": "The Adventures of the Little Prince", "title_japanese": "\u661f\u306e\u738b\u5b50\u3055\u307e\u3000\u30d7\u30c1\u30fb\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9", "title_synonyms": ["Hoshi no Ojisama Petit Prince", "The Little Prince", "Le Petit Prince", "The Prince of the Stars: Le Petit Prince"], "type": "TV", "source": "Novel", "episodes": 35, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "1978-07-04T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "1979-03-27T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 4, "month": 7, "year": 1978}, "to": {"day": 27, "month": 3, "year": 1979}}, "string": "Jul 4, 1978 to Mar 27, 1979"}, "duration": "24 min per ep", "rating": "G - All Ages", "score": 6.77, "scored_by": 954, "rank": 5614, "popularity": 11065, "members": 2804, "favorites": 12, "synopsis": "The Little Prince lives on Asteroid B612, a tiny rock floating in space.

One day, a puppet he is carving out of wood begins to speak even before he has finished shaping it. The old man names the puppet Pinocchio, and treats him as the son he never had. The puppet is dreadfully naughty and causes trouble for the old man, but his heart is in the right place and he earns Jeppet\u2019s love as though he were a human son. However, tragedy befalls the pair. Pinocchio is deceived by the wicked fox Dino and his sidekick, the cat Witch, while on his way to school. Pinocchio and his friend Gina the duck are sold to the master of a puppet show, with little hope of ever reuniting with kind old Jeppet. The naughty puppet eventually runs away in order to search for his surrogate father, and finds himself in the middle of adventure after adventure, matching wits with the crafty Dino and Witch. His efforts to stay out of mischief never seem to work, and misfortune always seeks out our wooden hero. If Pinocchio can only manage to stay out of trouble, his ultimate wish will be granted and his dream will become a reality. Delighting and entertaining, The Adventures of Pinocchio shows us that a pure heart and good intentions are rewarded, and that true love can indeed create miracles.\n\n(Source: Nipponanimation)\n\nNote that the character is actually called \"Piccolino\" in this adaptation.", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 1976, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": "Unknown"}, "producers": [], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Nippon Animation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/22/Nippon_Animation"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 15, "type": "anime", "name": "Kids", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/15/Kids"}]}, {"mal_id": 3064, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/3064/Kizuoibito", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/53623.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/53623t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/53623l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/53623.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/53623t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/5/53623l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Kizuoibito"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u50b7\u8ffd\u3044\u4eba"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Wounded Man"}], "title": "Kizuoibito", "title_english": "Wounded Man", "title_japanese": "\u50b7\u8ffd\u3044\u4eba", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "OVA", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 5, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "1986-07-05T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "1988-08-25T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 5, "month": 7, "year": 1986}, "to": {"day": 25, "month": 8, "year": 1988}}, "string": "Jul 5, 1986 to Aug 25, 1988"}, "duration": "35 min per ep", "rating": "R+ - Mild Nudity", "score": 4.03, "scored_by": 882, "rank": 14161, "popularity": 11153, "members": 2733, "favorites": 5, "synopsis": "Yuko Kusaka is a Japanese journalist sent to Brazil to do a report on the gold rush phenomenon that seems to be making many people rich from night to day.
