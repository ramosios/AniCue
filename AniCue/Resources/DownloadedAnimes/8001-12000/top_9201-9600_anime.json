Father Oliver is a priest who has left his order and traveled to the island of G in order to discover the truth behind it. He ends up making the acquaintance of a young girl named Ohri, who turns out to be quite adept in magic.\n\nMeanwhile, the head of the order has hired a dark elf named, Suzu, to track down Oliver and bring him back. Suzu finds him easily enough. However, she hadn't anticipated the powerful sorceress in his company, Ohri. The girl disposes of Suzu for the moment, and she and the Father continue on.

Although she is prepared to carry out her duty as a maiden of the household, the defiant boy will ensure that none can bring harm to whom he loves most.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Based on the erotic game developed by AliceSoft, released in 2012.", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 45, "type": "anime", "name": "Pink Pineapple", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/45/Pink_Pineapple"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 1374, "type": "anime", "name": "Office TakeOut", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1374/Office_TakeOut"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 12, "type": "anime", "name": "Hentai", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/12/Hentai"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 10728, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/10728/Maid_Ane", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1518/112488.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1518/112488t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1518/112488l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1518/112488.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1518/112488t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1518/112488l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Maid Ane"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Maid-Ane"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u30e1\u30a4\u30c9\u59c9"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Maid for Pleasure"}], "title": "Maid Ane", "title_english": "Maid for Pleasure", "title_japanese": "\u30e1\u30a4\u30c9\u59c9", "title_synonyms": ["Maid-Ane"], "type": "OVA", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 2, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2011-08-19T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2011-12-16T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 19, "month": 8, "year": 2011}, "to": {"day": 16, "month": 12, "year": 2011}}, "string": "Aug 19, 2011 to Dec 16, 2011"}, "duration": "27 min per ep", "rating": "Rx - Hentai", "score": 6.12, "scored_by": 1713, "rank": null, "popularity": 9393, "members": 4680, "favorites": 8, "synopsis": "One day Yuuta comes home to find his childhood friend Akie has returned to his country village.

Human Crossing examines the lives of a boxer whose dark past is rekindled by his estranged mother in \"The Wound\", an idealistic lawyer who fights for an underprivileged young mother in \"The 25th Hour\", a workaholic businessman who rediscovers what's most important in life in \"A Promise\", and an independent woman who reunites with her deadbeat father in \"Direction.\"\n\nHuman Crossing is a collection of vignettes about hope, a reminder of the small victories one can achieve amid the vicissitudes of life. \n\n(Source: Geneon, edited)", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 2003, "broadcast": {"day": "Sundays", "time": "00:55", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Sundays at 00:55 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 16, "type": "anime", "name": "TV Tokyo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"}, {"mal_id": 67, "type": "anime", "name": "OB Planning", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/67/OB_Planning"}, {"mal_id": 3087, "type": "anime", "name": "Shogakukan Productions", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/3087/Shogakukan_Productions"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 490, "type": "anime", "name": "Maiden Japan", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/490/Maiden_Japan"}, {"mal_id": 1459, "type": "anime", "name": "Geneon Entertainment USA", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1459/Geneon_Entertainment_USA"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 179, "type": "anime", "name": "A.C.G.T.", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/179/ACGT"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 42, "type": "anime", "name": "Seinen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}]}, {"mal_id": 34734, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/34734/Minami_Kamakura_Koukou_Joshi_Jitensha-bu__Kita_yo_Taiwan", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1689/148348.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1689/148348t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1689/148348l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1689/148348.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1689/148348t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1689/148348l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Minami Kamakura Koukou Joshi Jitensha-bu: Kita yo, Taiwan!"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Minami Kamakura High School Girls Cycling Club: Here We Come"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Taiwan!"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u5357\u938c\u5009\u9ad8\u6821\u5973\u5b50\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u90e8 \u7279\u5225\u7de8\u300c\u6765\u305f\u3088\u3001\u53f0\u6e7e!!\u300d"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Minami Kamakura High School Girls Cycling Club: We're In Taiwan!!"}, {"type": "German", "title": "kura High School Girls Cycling Club: We\u2019re In Taiwan!!"}, {"type": "Spanish", "title": "Minami Kamakura High School Girls Cycling Club Episodio 13: \u00a1Estamos en Taiw\u00e1n!"}, {"type": "French", "title": "Minami Kamakura High School Girls Cycling Club : Ta\u00efwan, nous voil\u00e0 !"}], "title": "Minami Kamakura Koukou Joshi Jitensha-bu: Kita yo, Taiwan!", "title_english": "Minami Kamakura High School Girls Cycling Club: We're In Taiwan!!", "title_japanese": "\u5357\u938c\u5009\u9ad8\u6821\u5973\u5b50\u81ea\u8ee2\u8eca\u90e8 \u7279\u5225\u7de8\u300c\u6765\u305f\u3088\u3001\u53f0\u6e7e!!\u300d", "title_synonyms": ["Minami Kamakura High School Girls Cycling Club: Here We Come", "Taiwan!"], "type": "Special", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2017-05-15T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 15, "month": 5, "year": 2017}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "May 15, 2017"}, "duration": "23 min", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 6.58, "scored_by": 2193, "rank": 6738, "popularity": 9435, "members": 4599, "favorites": 1, "synopsis": "Unaired episode included with the special edition BD release.\n\nThe girls hear from school principal Ryuko that the school is considering Taiwan as the destination for the school trip.

Some changes were made such as Lupin was no longer a thief but a detective, Jigen was no longer a smoker and it was set in the future. It was decided that the series was going to be called Ars\u00e8ne et Cie in France while it was called Lupin VIII internationally. Rintaro (Shigeyuki Hayashi) who worked on Captain Harlock and Galaxy Express 999 was the director and Shingo Araki was brought in as a character designer along with Michi Himeno. Monkey Punch had originally came up with character designs of the cast however the character designs had changed from his early designs. There was a problem during production and that was with the Maurice Leblanc estate. While the Lupin name was used in Japan and Italy at this point without issues, the Maurice Leblanc estate demanded money for the use of the Lupin name while TMS and DiC refused to pay what they were asking. This was also the same issue that had problems releasing the series outside of Japan with France adopting the Edgar de la Cambriole name, Lupin was renamed to Wolf or Cliff in the US while Spain and Italy that kept the Lupin name had to distance from Ars\u00e8ne Lupin affecting later dubbed episodes of Lupin the 3rd Part 2.

They soon discover an important clue: Professor Yuko's planner had been marked on the very night she was killed... marked with the names of seven girls. \n\nWith this evidence, the boys begin their investigations... and they'll use any method required in order to find the murderer. Through rape, manipulation and torture, they uncover important details, but piecing the puzzle together won't be easy.

At the age of 34 he inherits great wealth after his father dies and forgives his son.\n\nWhen Yunosuke is 57, one of his tailors named Juzo comes to see him before setting out for Edo. Juzo has unwisely made a bet with a rich merchant that he will sleep with Komurasaki, the most renowned courtesan in Edo, at the first meeting. If he succeeds he will win a villa, but if he loses he will lose his manhood. Yunosuke is astounded as he knows how hard the high rank courtesans are to get. The best courtesans, tayu, as well as being beautiful, were highly cultured, being educated in poetry, calligraphy, painting, tea ceremony and other arts. They would sleep with a client only on the third night, the other two nights being taken up with greetings and other social niceties. Humble men, to whom they were 'untouchable' looked up to them with adoration and respect.\n\nIndignant, Yunosuke takes Juzo to Edo and enables him to meet Komurasaki. Juzo is a laughing-stock at the tea-house because of his nervousness, and soon becomes drunk. He clumsily spills wine over the courtesan's kimono. Unperturbed, she goes out and returns wearing a fresh, identical garment.\n\n(Source: AniDB)", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 245, "type": "anime", "name": "TOHO", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/245/TOHO"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 391, "type": "anime", "name": "Grouper Productions", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/391/Grouper_Productions"}, {"mal_id": 1952, "type": "anime", "name": "Animation Staff Room", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1952/Animation_Staff_Room"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 12, "type": "anime", "name": "Hentai", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/12/Hentai"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 13, "type": "anime", "name": "Historical", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}, {"mal_id": 40, "type": "anime", "name": "Psychological", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 42829, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/42829/Boukyaku_Battery", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1216/113444.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1216/113444t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1216/113444l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1216/113444.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1216/113444t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1216/113444l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Boukyaku Battery"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Boukyaku Battery: Jump Festa 2020 Special"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u5fd8\u5374\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Oblivion Battery: Jump Festa 2020 Special"}], "title": "Boukyaku Battery", "title_english": "Oblivion Battery: Jump Festa 2020 Special", "title_japanese": "\u5fd8\u5374\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc", "title_synonyms": ["Boukyaku Battery: Jump Festa 2020 Special"], "type": "ONA", "source": "Manga", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2020-10-11T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 11, "month": 10, "year": 2020}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Oct 11, 2020"}, "duration": "20 min", "rating": "PG-13 - Teens 13 or older", "score": 6.39, "scored_by": 1063, "rank": 7941, "popularity": 9591, "members": 4381, "favorites": 19, "synopsis": "High school student Tarou Yamada wants to escape his past as a baseball player after a devastating loss against an elite team.
