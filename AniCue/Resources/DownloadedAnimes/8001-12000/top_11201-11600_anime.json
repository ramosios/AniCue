Out of gratitude, Sara became Dr. Chang's protege in the method of psychic feedback, the method which was used to cure her of her insecurities.\n\nHowever, Dr. Sara's method of therapy is vastly different than what Dr. Chang had used. By swinging her huge breasts in a circle, she is able to induce a hypnotic trance in her patients, after which she is able to learn what is bothering the patient and offer the proper solution. There is a risk of using this: Sara is often vulnerable to the sexual appetites of her patients and she must maintain control of the situation\n\nSara is not alone, though. She is often accompanied by Tamine, a man who cannot seem to get a woman, no matter how he tries. But Tamine is devoted to Sara (mostly because of her huge breasts, which he is able to cop a feel whenever the chance arises), and aids her in helping others in need.", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 470, "type": "anime", "name": "GAGA", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/470/GAGA"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 284, "type": "anime", "name": "Central Park Media", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/284/Central_Park_Media"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 7, "type": "anime", "name": "J.C.Staff", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/7/JCStaff"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 26, "type": "anime", "name": "Girls Love", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/26/Girls_Love"}, {"mal_id": 12, "type": "anime", "name": "Hentai", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/12/Hentai"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 2728, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/2728/TWO-MIX__White_Reflection", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/34687.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/34687t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/34687l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/34687.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/34687t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/34687l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "TWO-MIX: White Reflection"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "TWO-MIX: WHITE REFLECTION"}], "title": "TWO-MIX: White Reflection", "title_english": null, "title_japanese": "TWO-MIX: WHITE REFLECTION", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "Music", "source": "Music", "episodes": 1, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "1997-03-13T00:00:00+00:00", "to": null, "prop": {"from": {"day": 13, "month": 3, "year": 1997}, "to": {"day": null, "month": null, "year": null}}, "string": "Mar 13, 1997"}, "duration": "4 min", "rating": "G - All Ages", "score": 6.75, "scored_by": 1668, "rank": null, "popularity": 11207, "members": 2686, "favorites": 2, "synopsis": "A music video to Two-Mix's \"White Reflection\"; the group, in animated form, notices a strange light and follows it to various locations.", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 28, "type": "anime", "name": "OLM", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/28/OLM"}], "genres": [], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 19, "type": "anime", "name": "Music", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/19/Music"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 4386, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/4386/Great_Mazinger_tai_Getter_Robo_G__Kuuchuu_Daigekitotsu", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1736/99759.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1736/99759t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1736/99759l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1736/99759.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1736/99759t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1736/99759l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": "Od7iXPbRC5A", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od7iXPbRC5A", "embed_url": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/Od7iXPbRC5A?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1", "images": {"image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/Od7iXPbRC5A/default.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/Od7iXPbRC5A/sddefault.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/Od7iXPbRC5A/mqdefault.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/Od7iXPbRC5A/hqdefault.jpg", "maximum_image_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/Od7iXPbRC5A/maxresdefault.jpg"}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Great Mazinger tai Getter Robo G: Kuuchuu Daigekitotsu"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Great Mazinger tai Getter Robo G: Kuuchuu Dai-Gekitotsu"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Great Mazinger vs. Getter Robo G: Kuuchuu Dai-Gekitotsu"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "Great Mazinger Vs.

Riki has a six-pointed star emblazoned on his hand, while Nachi has a swastika on his, the significance of which go unexplained.

In a tangle of subplots involving old rivalries and injuries, and a mixed-race player seeking his identity and his lost mother (who turns out to be in jail), Shingo develops his skills as a center forward and looks forward to playing a visiting Brazilian squad. He is seriously injured in a game, but his talent, which even the legendary Brazilian Pele recognizes, is equaled by his determination. With the help of a friend of his old rival Matsuki, he recovers to help the team to victory. \n\nDefinitely melodrama rather than a sports series proper, this is the first in the line of Japanese soccer soaps that stretches to Captain Tsubasa and beyond. Based on a manga by Ikki Kajiwara and Kosei Sonoda. \n\n(Source: The Anime Ecyclopedia)", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 1970, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": "Unknown"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 16, "type": "anime", "name": "TV Tokyo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"}, {"mal_id": 479, "type": "anime", "name": "DOGA Productions", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/479/DOGA_Productions"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 2947, "type": "anime", "name": "Tokyo TV Douga", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2947/Tokyo_TV_Douga"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 30, "type": "anime", "name": "Sports", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/30/Sports"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 77, "type": "anime", "name": "Team Sports", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/77/Team_Sports"}], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 5203, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/5203/Shin_Maple_Town_Monogatari__Palm_Town-hen", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/56391.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/56391t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/56391l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/56391.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/56391t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/56391l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Shin Maple Town Monogatari: Palm Town-hen"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "New Maple Town Stories"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u65b0\u30e1\u30a4\u30d7\u30eb\u30bf\u30a6\u30f3\u7269\u8a9e \u30d1\u30fc\u30e0\u30bf\u30a6\u30f3\u7de8"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Palm Town"}], "title": "Shin Maple Town Monogatari: Palm Town-hen", "title_english": "Palm Town", "title_japanese": "\u65b0\u30e1\u30a4\u30d7\u30eb\u30bf\u30a6\u30f3\u7269\u8a9e \u30d1\u30fc\u30e0\u30bf\u30a6\u30f3\u7de8", "title_synonyms": ["New Maple Town Stories"], "type": "TV", "source": "Original", "episodes": 50, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "1987-01-18T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "1987-12-27T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 18, "month": 1, "year": 1987}, "to": {"day": 27, "month": 12, "year": 1987}}, "string": "Jan 18, 1987 to Dec 27, 1987"}, "duration": "24 min per ep", "rating": "G - All Ages", "score": 6.87, "scored_by": 984, "rank": 5075, "popularity": 11373, "members": 2569, "favorites": 6, "synopsis": "The story take place in new town called \"Palm Town\" which it is the new town that Patty and her Aunt Jane moved to since Jane's husband George run a medical center there.

The books gives several good tips for bringing up a smart and well behaved kappa, and it all seems very simple. Unfortunately, putting these techniques into practice and actually making them work is not quite as easy as the book implies. Kaatan seems to understand things at first, but usually ends up either forgetting what he's learned, or isn't interested in learning in the first place.

She tells him that everyone in the family is going home to her father\u2019s hometown. When Hamtaro tells his friends about it, Maxwell pulls out a Ham-Ham source book. It\u2019s a book on old hamster history. \n\nAccording to the book, there is a \u201chomeland\u201d for hamsters called \u201cHamja Kingdom\u201d. When the Ham-Hams build a sand castle and recite a spell exactly the way it is written in the book, they are whooshed to the Kingdom.

An asphalt concrete highway runs through the area, used from time to time by various cargo trucks. Oscar is generally searching for food or water; he sometimes discovers liquid, in bottles or elsewhere, but is usually frustrated from recovering it for drink. An oasis supplies the only fresh water in the area, but its thick population of irascible and hungry crocodiles renders it inaccessible. At considerable personal risk (lizard is a delicacy for chickens), Oscar occasionally manages to steal an egg from a nearby hen coop, and he sometimes explores one of the piles of trash that litter the parched landscape. Popy, a fennec fox; Buck, a vulture; and Harchi, a hyena, inhabit a derelict school bus situated on a neighboring hill, but they mostly race about on a cast-off warehouse or grocery cart powered by Harchi and directed by Popy. Like Oscar, the trio constantly search for food and water - often competing with him, sometimes abusing him as a means, but occasionally cooperating with him when it suits their purpose. The main characters often find themselves falling off cliffs a la Wile E.
