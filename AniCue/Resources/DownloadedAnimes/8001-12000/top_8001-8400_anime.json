Amamori Hajime is just a normal, everyday elementary school student, trying to study and hanging out with his crazy pals. But then one day as his father is testing a piece of equipment he has been working on, something causes it to blow up, taking the house with it! Now orphaned, Hajime is taken in by his uncle, who is an astronomer. There at his uncle's observatory, he meets a girl he's seen before and developed somewhat of a crush on. He finds out her name is Yukino Yayoi, and her parents run a ramen shop in town. But even better than that, she's his uncle's assistant! What luck! \n\nBut Yayoi isn't exactly what she seems. There is a reason she helps out Amamori-san at the observatory. She is the Millennial Queen (Sen-Nen Joou), specially chosen by her home planet, LaMetal, to go to Earth and help prepare for the possible annihilation of the planet. What will cause this disaster? LaMetal has an extremely elliptical orbit, which sends it very, very near Earth every 1000 years. When it gets close enough, the earth reacts, causing all sorts of natural disasters. Although she was chosen with the idea of protecting LaMetal in mind, her personal plan is to evacuate as many humans as she can to LaMetal, so if their planet is destroyed, they will survive. \n\nHowever, there is one person who strives to stop her plan, the head of the Millennial Theives. Why does he want to stop Yayoi? And how does he know about the Millennial Queen, anyway? \n\n(Source: AniDB)", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 1981, "broadcast": {"day": "Thursdays", "time": "19:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Thursdays at 19:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 169, "type": "anime", "name": "Fuji TV", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/169/Fuji_TV"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 376, "type": "anime", "name": "Sentai Filmworks", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}, {"mal_id": 2278, "type": "anime", "name": "Harmony Gold", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2278/Harmony_Gold"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 18, "type": "anime", "name": "Toei Animation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/18/Toei_Animation"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 7, "type": "anime", "name": "Mystery", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 2982, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/2982/Yuuwaku", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1864/116163.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1864/116163t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1864/116163l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1864/116163.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1864/116163t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1864/116163l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Yuuwaku"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u8a98\u60d1"}, {"type": "English", "title": "Temptation"}], "title": "Yuuwaku", "title_english": "Temptation", "title_japanese": "\u8a98\u60d1", "title_synonyms": [], "type": "OVA", "source": "Visual novel", "episodes": 2, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2003-07-25T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2003-10-31T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 25, "month": 7, "year": 2003}, "to": {"day": 31, "month": 10, "year": 2003}}, "string": "Jul 25, 2003 to Oct 31, 2003"}, "duration": "30 min per ep", "rating": "Rx - Hentai", "score": 6.4, "scored_by": 2535, "rank": null, "popularity": 8101, "members": 6842, "favorites": 28, "synopsis": "Unable to resist his animal urges, a professor is caught red-handed having sex with a busty coed!

At the time of its release, Senya Ichiya Monogatari was the longest animated film sitting at 130 minutes. It was also the first X-rated animation in Japan and claims to be the first erotic animated feature film.

In order to protect the colonies and maintain law and order in the solar system, the Earth Federation Government (EFG) was created.

Out of desperation she turns to the message board Free Friends to earn some money. She develops a relationship with her first partner, Kaito, without realizing that they're much more than strangers...\n\nKaito, the newest student teacher at Minatohashi Higashi Academy, has a vice. Unable and unwilling to form meaningful, intimate relationships with other people, he instead satiates his need for intimacy through compensated dating. In order to feed this habit, he uses a message board known as Free Friends. Through its services, he can make the necessary arrangements and appointments with the various girls who also use the site, mainly students running away from home or simply in need of extra income.\n\nHis troubles trace back to a deeply seated complex: a hollow, yearning feeling brought on by the thought and sight of violets. Violets, or \"Sumire\", remind him of the sister he'd been separated from during their childhood when their parents had divorced. Only by losing himself in a woman's body can he rid himself of those clinging, nostalgic feelings.\n\nRight before the school year begins, the mere reminder of the academy's famed violet flowerbeds (despite them not even being in bloom at the time) is enough to drive Kaito to Free Friends. A seemingly routine exchange leaves him completely unprepared for the girl waiting for him: an absolutely stunning beauty by the pseudonym of \"Sumi\".\n\nA few days later, he discovers that \"Sumi\" is not only a student at the exact same school he teaches at, but that her classmates call her \"Sumire\". Incredulous, Kaito checks the school rosters. Surely it's not the same Sumire he knows; surely it's just another girl with the same given name? But as if setting him up for the universe's biggest punchline, the only Sumire at the school is none other than his very own Shinozaki Sumire, the sister his mother had taken away from him.

The trouble is living long enough to get there.\n\n(Source: AniDB)", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 45, "type": "anime", "name": "Pink Pineapple", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/45/Pink_Pineapple"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 97, "type": "anime", "name": "ADV Films", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/97/ADV_Films"}, {"mal_id": 296, "type": "anime", "name": "Critical Mass Video", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/296/Critical_Mass_Video"}, {"mal_id": 813, "type": "anime", "name": "SoftCel Pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/813/SoftCel_Pictures"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 48, "type": "anime", "name": "AIC", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/48/AIC"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 37, "type": "anime", "name": "Supernatural", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}, {"mal_id": 12, "type": "anime", "name": "Hentai", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/12/Hentai"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": []}, {"mal_id": 30454, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/30454/Maro_no_Kanja_wa_Gatenkei", "images": {"jpg": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1279/104290.jpg", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1279/104290t.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1279/104290l.jpg"}, "webp": {"image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1279/104290.webp", "small_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1279/104290t.webp", "large_image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1279/104290l.webp"}}, "trailer": {"youtube_id": null, "url": null, "embed_url": null, "images": {"image_url": null, "small_image_url": null, "medium_image_url": null, "large_image_url": null, "maximum_image_url": null}}, "approved": true, "titles": [{"type": "Default", "title": "Maro no Kanja wa Gatenkei"}, {"type": "Synonym", "title": "The Patients of Dr. Maro"}, {"type": "Japanese", "title": "\u9ebb\u5442\u306e\u60a3\u8005\u306f\u30ac\u30c6\u30f3\u7cfb"}], "title": "Maro no Kanja wa Gatenkei", "title_english": null, "title_japanese": "\u9ebb\u5442\u306e\u60a3\u8005\u306f\u30ac\u30c6\u30f3\u7cfb", "title_synonyms": ["The Patients of Dr. Maro"], "type": "OVA", "source": "Visual novel", "episodes": 2, "status": "Finished Airing", "airing": false, "aired": {"from": "2015-05-01T00:00:00+00:00", "to": "2015-06-05T00:00:00+00:00", "prop": {"from": {"day": 1, "month": 5, "year": 2015}, "to": {"day": 5, "month": 6, "year": 2015}}, "string": "May 1, 2015 to Jun 5, 2015"}, "duration": "25 min per ep", "rating": "Rx - Hentai", "score": 6.01, "scored_by": 2472, "rank": null, "popularity": 8311, "members": 6438, "favorites": 10, "synopsis": "Based on the adult game by Elf.\n\nMaro works as a doctor.
